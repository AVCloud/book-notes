## Adversaries into Allies: Win People Over Without Manipulation or Coercion

by Bob Burg

### Section 1: The Five Principles of Ultimate Influence

* Ultimate Influence encompasses not only the ability to move someone to action but the manner in which you move them.
* Moving a person by force is not sustainable: Once the person loses his positional authority, his ability to force others to action is gone.
* All actions we as human beings take are based on self-interest, based on our personal value system.
* All things being equal, people do business with, refer business to, and allow themselves to be influenced by those people they know, like, and trust.
* To elicit like and trust, give someone else a personal benefit for taking action.

#### Chapter 1: The Five Principles

* Only when we are in control of our emotions are we able to act out of thought, out of consciousness, and create a winning situation for everyone.
* Feelings are self-justifying, with a set of perceptions and proofs all their own; this is when we rationalize.
* Each of us sees the world in a unique way based on upbringing, environment, schooling, popular media, and the people with whom we associate.
* Such different belief systems leads to non-understanding, which in turn leads to misunderstanding.
* The ego is nothing more than one's sense of self. It is the driving force in everything people do, and it is highly sensitive.
* Being able to move a person to your side of an issue comes down to how you make him feel about himself.
* A frame is the premise or context from which everything else in your interpersonal transactions takes place.
* Set the frame in every interpersonal conflict; otherwise you allow the other person to, and it won't serve you well.
* Tact is the ability to say something in a way that makes the other person feel less threatened or defensive and more open to your ideas.
* Empathy is related to tact but can be defined as the ability to identify with another person's feelings.

#### Chapter 2: It's (Much) More Than Just About Being Nice

* People take advantage of you not because you are nice, but because you allow yourself to be taken advantage of.

#### Chapter 3: Persuasion Versus Manipulation

* There is perhaps nothing more dangerous than a bad person with good people skills.
* Manipulation aims at control, not cooperation. Persuasion enhances the self-esteem of the other party, leading to better responses.
* A manipulator uses knowledge to only his advantage, while a persuader uses it to the other person's advantage as well.
* A manipulator will play on your negative emotions in order to elicit your compliance, which a persuader will never do.
* Often people resort to manipulation because they don't know how to effective persuade; their tactics are what's negative, not their intent.
* The Ultimate Influencer always asks "Am I doing something that will hurt this person or be contrary to their best interests?"
* If you are sure that your point of view will benefit them, it is your responsibility to persuade them about this, not to manipulate them.

### Section 2: Control Your Own Emotions

* If you choose to control your emotions, or to respond instead of react, you can influence almost every interaction for the better.
* In a frustrating challenge, your emotions are the only part of the situation that is in your power to control.

#### Chapter 4: Responding Versus Reacting

* Self-control of your emotions is important and powerful not only in what it allows you to do but who it allows you to be.
* When you react, you are being controlled by outside circumstances. When you respond, you are in control of yourself, of your emotions.

#### Chapter 5: Effectively Handle Verbal Attacks

* Listen and remain calm. Then say "I... might possibly owe you an apology. Did I say or do something to offend you?"
* If he or she is simply having a bad day, say "I understand. I've had those myself. Is there anything I can do to help?"
* If your discussion turns less than cordial, the key to being heard is to actually lower your voice.

#### Chapter 6: Make Calm Your Default Setting

* Your default setting to pressure situations is directly proportional to your ability to problem solve, to live in the solution, and to lead.
* To make this change, vividly imagine the next time a potentially upsetting situation occurs, you become calm. Then follow through.
* The ability to remain calm when others aren't is another separator that creates influence and allows us to gently persuade.
* Understand the default setting of others. Realize you can't change them; instead, work within that context.
* The more you help them operate their default settings successfully, the better you can lead, persuade, and influence successfully.

#### Chapter 7: Overcome Your Anger

* Anger is a turnoff to people. You might be able to obtain compliance through displays of anger, but never commitment.
* You can't effectively influence someone against whom you hold a grudge. And the negative energy you emit to everyone will make you less attractive, and diminish your influence.
* Focus on gratitude for all the good in your life. The more in tune you are with gratitude, the less you'll feel the need to be angry.

#### Chapter 8: The Persuasive Power of Positive Detachment

* When detached from an outcome in a positive way, you'll be less bothered if you don't get what you want, but chances are better that you will get what you want.
* Without the attachment you are able to focus more clearly on your goal without the distraction of fear, which always accompanies attachment.
* Do your very best; then, regardless of the result, you can have peace of mind knowing you gave it your wall.

#### Chapter 9: Think Before You Speak

* It's best to handle conflict before it ever takes root; the next best thing you can do is stop it before it escalates.
* Instead of exploding at someone via email, simply write it without sending it, wait before sending, or enlist help to critique and edit.

#### Chapter 10: Agree to Disagree

* Agree to disagree with someone when any further discussion cannot possibly help your relationship, but might just hurt it.
* Honor a person's right to believe a certain way without agreeing with it; this leaves that person much more open to your other ideas when you speak again.

#### Chapter 11: Consider the Source

* First, determine whether a criticism is worth taking seriously, given the source. Regardless of the source, do not take it personally.

### Section 3: Understand the Clash of Belief Systems

* A belief system is how we see the world. Truth is objective fact, and belief systems color that truth, providing a unique interpretation of it.
* The trouble is when we fail to notice our belief systems at work and operate in accordance with our beliefs, even harmful ones.
* Without understanding that everyone operates out of their own paradigm and worldview, we are stuck on the same level of misunderstanding and miscommunication as everyone else.

#### Chapter 12: Belief Systems -- the Problem and the Solution

* Beliefs are extremely difficult to change because they operate primarily on an unconscious level.
* We view things not as they are, but as we are. We believe in truths, and we will unconsciously steer our way to our truths, according to our beliefs.
* In conflict, ask yourself: How is my or his belief system distorting the truth? What questions can I ask him to clarify his belief system? What information can I give to clarify my belief system?

#### Chapter 13: "How Would You Define...?"

* When parties involved are defining a word differently, they may not even know what they are disagreeing about.
* Look out for words that are subjective, like "soon," "often," "later," "nearby," and "long" and ask for clarification.

#### Chapter 14: Accept the Responsibility for Communication

* When it comes to effective communication, the onus is on us to be sure that the other person understands our point, want, or need.
* Because we come from different belief systems, the chances of someone knowing what we want without us clarifying are very slim.
* Avoid giving or accepting mixed messages, such as saying contradictory things, or contradictory body language.

#### Chapter 15: The Importance of Conscious Awareness

* When you disagree or feel offended by someone, ask if your feelings are being filtered through your paradigm, or if you're making a decision about that person based on limited information.
* When you are consciously aware, you can think and act out of strength and choice instead of unconsciously accepted programming.

#### Chapter 16: Persona or Not? How Do You Know?

* Give people the benefit of the doubt; judging favorably hurts no one, helps everyone, and simply makes a lot more sense.
* Much of what we take personally isn't personal, but the result of transferring our belief system onto others.
* Use an "I message" to determine if something was personal: "I felt hurt... I took it personally... For my own clarification, I'd like to ask you about it."

#### Chapter 17: Love Languages From Liberty the Cat

* We receive love as words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch.
* Determine your love language as well as the other person's, and be sure to stay conscious of both.

#### Chapter 18: First, Know the Issue. Then, Choose the Words

* Understanding the other person's belief system, or underlying cause of their position, is critical to choosing the most persuasive words.
* Discover why someone feels a certain way, and then prepare your presentation in a way that honors them, their egos, and their intent.
* By acknowledging their intent, that frame continues to place you all on the same side, all wishing for the same effect.

#### Chapter 19: The Answer? Based on What Information?

* We provide advice or opinions that would serve us based on our values and our beliefs, and fill in any blanks needed to reinforce our story.
* Do not provide advice or opinions if you do not have enough information to go on.

#### Chapter 20: Perceptual Realities Equal Different Conclusions

* We absolutely must see the reality based on their perception if we are going to obtain buy-in to our suggestions and ideas.

### Section 4: Acknowledge Their Ego

* We're taught to ignore or obliterate the ego, but it motivates the good in our lives.
* Trouble happens when the part with unhealthy desires controls us, causing trouble and wreaking havoc in our affairs.

#### Chapter 22: Don't Shame or Embarrass

* If you want any chance of positively influencing a person, shaming them will totally sabotage it.
* Delivering your point in a way that leaves the other person's ego intact via tact, empathy, and kindness, earns their respect.
* Don't correct another person publicly just to make your point. A huge part of influence is that the person likes you and trusts you.
* If you have to insult someone to be funny, it probably best not to be funny. But self-deprecating humor is always disarming.

#### Chapter 23: Be a Judge, Not a Lawyer

* In a disagreement, see the situation from your side and theirs. Focus especially on theirs since you are predisposed to see your side.

#### Chapter 24: The Principle of Agreement

* When someone says something you know is wrong, agree to disarm the person. Then transition into methods of persuasion.
* Then follow with "I'm wondering if..." or "Here's what I'm thinking" and make your suggestion. But don't use the word "but."
* As the person is abiding, provide an out phrase, such as "If you can't do it, I'll definitely understand."

#### Chapter 25: Ego Repair

* When someone acts negative toward you, the reason why may not be the reason they give you. Dig for the real reason.
* Thanking someone in advance for what you want them to do can persuade them to do exactly what you thanked them for.

#### Chapter 26: The Power of Handwritten Notes

* In many situations, nothing makes an impact like a handwritten note of appreciation.
* With the advent of technology, those who write them stand out and are positioned more powerfully than those who don't.
* If you want to take an extra step that's even more powerful, type a note to his or her boss.

#### Chapter 27: Education -- A Powerful Key to Influence

* Edify people, or build them up in the minds of others and their own minds, even for the things you wish they would do.
* People will believe their own press and start adopting the traits and behaviors for which they're being praised.

#### Chapter 28: Do You Look For Disagreement?

* Pointing out the one contrarian example in an otherwise sound and principle-based statement comes across as argumentative and ego-based.
* If you must disagree, think about it first, look first for where you agree, use tact, and finally reconsider whether this is necessary.
* Ask if you are motivated by a genuine desire to add value, or if you're disagreeing to get attention, begin an argument, or feel better about yourself.

#### Chapter 29: Compliment the Uncomplimented

* Complimenting something who is usually not complimented has a tremendous impact on how far that person will go out of their way to help you.
* Those who might be deciding whether to do business with you or become more involved with you socially are watching how you treat others.

#### Chapter 30: Caught In the Act... Of Doing Something Right

* When you catch someone in the act of doing something right, acknowledge it verbally, and make sure everyone else sees and hears you do it.
* Whether positive or negative, behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated.

#### Chapter 31: "I Appreciate Ya"

* Instead of just saying thank you to someone, say "I appreciate you" to separate you from everyone else.

### Section 5: Setting the Frame

* Setting the frame is when we can influence another's response by controlling the stimulus, our action.
* In any interpersonal interaction, a frame will be set. Ensure that it is you, not the other person, who sets it.
* If the other person has entered the transaction setting a frame, reset their frame simply by setting your own.

#### Chapter 32: Positive Expectation Works, But Not Why You Think It Does

* By expecting someone to be helpful, you take on a corresponding attitude, which in turn changes his or her attitude. 
* If you display gratitude and appreciation for their kindness, they are going to respond by living up to those feelings.
* There may be nothing more powerful in beginning a relationship, conversation, or overcoming an interpersonal challenge than a smile.
* Smiles are the most contagious emotional signal of all, having an almost irresistible power to make other people smile in return.

#### Chapter 33: Framing Your Influence in Your First Conversation

* Focus on the other person. Show interest in them and make them feel good about themselves; they will like you and begin to trust you.
* Two Feel-Good Questions are how they got started in their line of business, and what they enjoy most about what they do.
* Ask how to know if someone you're speaking with is someone they'd like to meet. You communicate value.

#### Chapter 34: Sometimes, It's Good to Let 'Em See You Sweat

* While a slick person may overwhelm and dazzle, they typically are not as relatable as the "real" person.
* During those times when, for whatever reason, you feel overwhelmed, under-confident, or scared, just admit it, and win.

#### Chapter 35: The Ransburger Pivot

* Always begin with a point on which you both agree; this shows that you both want the same result, but have different views on how to get there.
* With the Ransburger Pivot, you pivot from a point you both agree on, and so it's easier for the other person to accept your new conclusion.
* Begin with "Like you, I want..." Add a lead-in phrase "I appreciate your thoughts" or "I agree with..."

#### Chapter 36: The Value of the Correct Phrase

* When attempting to express value to another person, people don't care how it affects you, but care how it affects them.

#### Chapter 37: "What Can I Do to Help?"

* Control your emotions, present a calm, self-controlled front, and set or reset the frame by asking "What can I do to help?"
