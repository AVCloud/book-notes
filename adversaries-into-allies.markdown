## Adversaries into Allies: Win People Over Without Manipulation or Coercion

### Section 1: The Five Principles of Ultimate Influence

* Ultimate Influence encompasses not only the ability to move someone to action but the manner in which you move them.
* Moving a person by force is not sustainable: Once the person loses his positional authority, his ability to force others to action is gone.
* All actions we as human beings take are based on self-interest, based on our personal value system.
* All things being equal, people do business with, refer business to, and allow themselves to be influenced by those people they know, like, and trust.
* To elicit like and trust, give someone else a personal benefit for taking action.

#### Chapter 1: The Five Principles

* Only when we are in control of our emotions are we able to act out of thought, out of consciousness, and create a winning situation for everyone.
* Feelings are self-justifying, with a set of perceptions and proofs all their own; this is when we rationalize.
* Each of us sees the world in a unique way based on upbringing, environment, schooling, popular media, and the people with whom we associate.
* Such different belief systems leads to non-understanding, which in turn leads to misunderstanding.
* The ego is nothing more than one's sense of self. It is the driving force in everything people do, and it is highly sensitive.
* Being able to move a person to your side of an issue comes down to how you make him feel about himself.
* A frame is the premise or context from which everything else in your interpersonal transactions takes place.
* Set the frame in every interpersonal conflict; otherwise you allow the other person to, and it won't serve you well.
* Tact is the ability to say something in a way that makes the other person feel less threatened or defensive and more open to your ideas.
* Empathy is related to tact but can be defined as the ability to identify with another person's feelings.

#### Chapter 2: It's (Much) More Than Just About Being Nice

* People take advantage of you not because you are nice, but because you allow yourself to be taken advantage of.

#### Chapter 3: Persuasion Versus Manipulation

* There is perhaps nothing more dangerous than a bad person with good people skills.
* Manipulation aims at control, not cooperation. Persuasion enhances the self-esteem of the other party, leading to better responses.
* A manipulator uses knowledge to only his advantage, while a persuader uses it to the other person's advantage as well.
* A manipulator will play on your negative emotions in order to elicit your compliance, which a persuader will never do.
* Often people resort to manipulation because they don't know how to effective persuade; their tactics are what's negative, not their intent.
* The Ultimate Influencer always asks "Am I doing something that will hurt this person or be contrary to their best interests?"
* If you are sure that your point of view will benefit them, it is your responsibility to persuade them about this, not to manipulate them.
