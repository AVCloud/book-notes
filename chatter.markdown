### Introduction

* People will run through walls for people they like. Use your likeability to get ahead.
* Chatter requires a sense of empathy, conversational techniques, and cultivating a presence. It also requires reading between the lines, examining body language, and noting response to stimuli.

### Principle 1: Bulletproof Your Nonverbal First Impression

* First impressions are made within 30 seconds. After that, your conversation partner will only look for cues and signs that confirm that impression.
* Being described as "nice" means you are an afterthought, and did not leave an impression.
* Always offer a handshake. Offer your hand first, to own and control the interaction. Take a step towards the other person, and lean in. Maintain eye contact, and maintain a smile throughout.
* Have an open, approachable stance. Don't cross your arms, or move back or turn away from the other person. Eliminate your nervous ticks, and slow your movements down.

### Principle 2: Bulletproof Your Verbal First Impression

* The verbal first impression governs the first 20 words out of your mouth. It's your elevator pitch.
* Prepare elevator pitches for questions like:
  * "Tell me about yourself."
  * "What did you do last weekend?"
  * "Where do you work?"
  * "What do you have planned for this weekend?"
  * "Do you live around here?"
  * "How do you know the person who introduced us?"
  * "Where are you from?"
  * "Where did you go to school?"
* Focus on using specific details that people can relate to, as well as the commonality you share with your conversation partner.

### Principle 3: What Would Jay Do?

* People like those who like them. When you react the way someone wants, it encourages that person to be more outgoing and open with you.
* Being genuinely curious and interested in your conversation partner is one of the keys to allowing them to feel comfortable enough to connect with you beyond a superficial level.
* Everyone has something to teach you, fascinate you with, and amaze you with. Commit to truly learning about the people you speak with, and wonder what they're truly like.

### Principle 4: Your Life is a Series of (Mini) Stories

* Nothing stops a conversation cold like a one word answer, so strive to make your life a series of mini stories. This also allows you control the image that you project. 
* Stories are an inside view into your personality, emotions, and passions, so learning them is a first step in allowing anyone to relate and feel connected to you.
* Prepare stories for:
  * your occupation
  * your week
  * your upcoming weekend
  * your hometown
  * your hobbies
  * your favorite music
  * your passions
  * your education
  * your apartment
  * your mutual friends
  * your dating history
  * your experience with wherever you are
  * the weather
  * your family
  * your pet
* Don't get too personal, too negative, or too controversial, and don't dominate the conversation.

### Principle 5: Thorough, Exhaustive, and Specific Details

* When answering questions, lead with a specific detail that begs to be asked about. Be graphic, and use extremely descriptive and colorful language.
* Adding personal details that are interesting and funny will lead your conversation partner to remember you through them.
* Moreover, it creates a direction for the conversation to follow, and so the conversation is easier to continue for your partner.
* Most importantly, it creates a personal connection and encourages your conversation partner to reciprocate. People like those who are similar to them, and details are an avenue to that discovery.

### Principle 6: Icebreak with Superficial Commonalities

* None of us can expect to be charming, witty, and engaged 100% of the time, so more often than not we rely on questions that discover superficial commonalities.
* For a man talking to another man, such topics include: women, sports, work/business, working out, food, and vehicles.
* For a woman talking to another woman, such topics include: physical appearance, recent events you've attended, food, and other women.
* When talking to the opposite sex, such topics include: working out, events you've attended, and mutual friends.
* Avoid questions relating to hobbies, interests, and occupation. First, you'll learn about those things organically. Second, they're so common that your conversation partner will have a canned answer ready, and will be bored and unstimulated.
* A great icebreaker on superficial commonalities is:
  # Discover something that you two share at the moment, such as a location, mutual friend, interest, etc.
  # Reveal something about yourself related to it. Focus on yourself.
  # Use your personal information to make a statement or prompt your partner to reply, gauge their reaction, share their own relation, and get them involved.
