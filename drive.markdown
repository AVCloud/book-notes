## Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us

by Daniel Pink

### Introduction

* It was long assumed that only biological drives and extrinsic motivators (rewards and punishments from the environment) powered behavior.
* Extrinsic rewards can deliver a short-term boost, but the effect can wear off and reduce a person's longer-term motivation in a project.
* Intrinsic rewards are more fragile than the other two, and need the right environment to survive.

### Part 1: A New Operating System

#### Chapter 1: The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0

* "Scientific management" treated workers as part in a complicated machine, which would respond to carrots and sticks as motivators.
* The absence of extrinsic rewards creates job dissatisfaction, but their presence does not create satisfaction. Intrinsic rewards do.
* The carrot and stick mentality is incompatible with how we *organize* what we do, how we *think* about what we do, and how we *do* what we do.
* Open source, low-profit LLCs, and social businesses reflect a shift from profit maximizing to purpose maximizing.
* Scientific management assumed that we are purely rational, but we do things for self-seeking, self-actualizing reasons.
* We classify work as either algorithmic or heuristic; the latter requires experimenting with possibilities to devise a novel solution.
* Carrots and sticks work well for algorithmic tasks, but heuristic tasks require creativity, which requires intrinsic motivation.

#### Chapter 2: Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don't Work

* The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table, or to satisfy "baseline rewards."
* The Sawyer Effect says that rewards can diminish intrinsic motivation, and thereby diminish performance, creativity, and upstanding behavior.
* Contingent and expected "if-then" rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy, leading to long-term damage.
* Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus. That is helpful for algorithmic work, but detrimental for heuristic work.
* Like a paradox, those who are least motivated to pursue extrinsic rewards create a better state of mind to eventually receive them.
* Intrinsic motivation, or the drive to do something because it is interesting, challenging, or absorbing, is essential for creativity.
* Rewards can taint altruistic or moral tasks, turning them into pure transactions with no intrinsic reward.
* Making an extrinsic reward the only destination that matters means that some people will take the quickest way there, along the low road.
* Rewards are addictive in that once offered, they're expected for any similar task; and once the status quo, they must be increased.
* Extrinsic motivators can reduce not just breadth but depth, fostering short-term thinking and ignoring the long-term.

#### Chapter 2A: ... and the Special Circumstances When They Do

* Without healthy baseline rewards, such as wages, benefits, and so on, motivation of any sort is difficult and often impossible.
* Rewards do not undermine people's intrinsic motivation for routine tasks, because there is no such motivation to undermine.
* For creative tasks where "if-then" rewards are a mistake, focus on "now that" rewards, or introduce rewards after the job is done.
* But repeated "now that" rewards can become expected "if then" entitlements, thereby reducing effective performance.
* Also consider intangible rewards like praise, and feedback that provides useful information.

#### Chapter 3: Type I and Type X

* Self-Determination Theory says that our innate needs are competence, autonomy, and relatedness, and when satisfied, we're motivated, productive, and happy.
* When we use rewards to motivate, that's when they're most demotivating; the less salient they are, the better.
* Theory X believes in the mediocrity of the masses, and so mediocrity becomes the ceiling of what you can achieve.
* Theory Y says that an interest in work is natural, creativity and ingenuity abound, and people will accept and even seek responsibility.
* Type X people are driven by external rewards and deeper satisfaction is welcome but secondary.
* Type I people are motivated by the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are simply a welcome bonus.
* Type I's almost always perform Type X's in the long run, but an intense focus on extrinsic rewards can deliver fast results in the short term.
* Type I's like recognition because it is a form of feedback, but for Type X's, recognition is a goal in itself.
* Type I's have higher self-esteem, better interpersonal relationships, and greater general well-being than Type X's.
