## Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us

by Daniel Pink

### Introduction

* It was long assumed that only biological drives and extrinsic motivators (rewards and punishments from the environment) powered behavior.
* Extrinsic rewards can deliver a short-term boost, but the effect can wear off and reduce a person's longer-term motivation in a project.
* Intrinsic rewards are more fragile than the other two, and need the right environment to survive.

* "Scientific management" treated workers as part in a complicated machine, which would respond to carrots and sticks as motivators.
* The absence of extrinsic rewards creates job dissatisfaction, but their presence does not create satisfaction. Intrinsic rewards do.
* The carrot and stick mentality is incompatible with how we *organize* what we do, how we *think* about what we do, and how we *do* what we do.
* Open source, low-profit LLCs, and social businesses reflect a shift from profit maximizing to purpose maximizing.
* Scientific management assumed that we are purely rational, but we do things for self-seeking, self-actualizing reasons.
* We classify work as either algorithmic or heuristic; the latter requires experimenting with possibilities to devise a novel solution.
* Carrots and sticks work well for algorithmic tasks, but heuristic tasks require creativity, which requires intrinsic motivation.
