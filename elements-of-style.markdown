### I. Elementary Rules of Usage
* pg 1: Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding _'s_, whatever the final consonant.
* pg 2: In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, add a comma after each term except the last.
* pg 2: When using however or a brief phrase as parenthetic, you can omit commas if the sentence flow is only slightly interrupted.
* pg 3: The abbreviation _Jr._ has commonly been regarded as parenthetic, but it is restrictive and should not be preceded by a comma.
* pg 5: If the connective _and_ introduces an independent clause, you can omit the comma if the relation between the two statements is close or immediate.
* pg 6: If a grammatically complete second clause is preceded by an adverb, and not by a conjunction, then a semicolon is still required.
* pg 6: A comma is preferable to a semicolon if the clauses or short and alike in form, or the tone is easy and conversational.
* pg 7: An emphatic word or expression can serve the purpose of a sentence if warranted; this typically happens in dialogue.
* pg 7: A colon has more effect than the comma, less separation than the semicolon, and more formality than the dash.
* pg 8: Join two independent clauses with a colon if the second interprets or amplifies the first.
* pg 9: A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses.
* pg 9: It is wrong to use a singular verb form in a relative clause following _one of..._ or an expression when the relative is its subject.
* pg 10: With _none_, use a singular verb when the word means _no one_ or _not one_, and a plural verb if it suggests more than one thing or person.
* pg 10: A singular subject remains such even if nouns are connected to it by _with_, _as well as_, _in addition to_, _except_, _together with_, and _no less than_.
* pg 12: A pronoun in a comparison is nomitive if it is the subject of an understood verb. In general, avoid such verbs by supplying them.
* pg 13: A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.

### II. Elementary Principles of Composition
* pg 15: The first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.
* pg 16: Begin a paragraph with a sentence that suggests the topic or one that helps the transition. 
* pg 17: Paragraph breaks used only for show read like the writing of commerce or of display advertising.
* pg 18: The need to make a particular word the subject of a sentence often determines whether active or passive voice is used.
* pg 18: Habitual use of the active voice makes for forcible writing; additionally, the sentence usually becomes shorter.
* pg 20: The reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; the reader wishes to be told what is. So express even a negative in a positive form.
* pg 20: Save the auxiliaries _would_, _should_, _could_, _may_, _might_, and _can_ for situations involving real uncertainty.
* pg 21: The surest way to arouse and hold the reader's attention is by being specific, definite, and concrete.
* pg 22: In exposition and argument, even when dealing with general principles, the writer must furnish particular instances of their application.
* pg 23: Write with vigor; this requires not that sentences be short or that detail is avoided, but that every word tell.
* pg 24: _The fact that_ should be revised out of every sentence; _who is_, _which was_, and the like are often superfluous.
* pg 26: Recast loose sentences to remove the monotony; do so however best represents the real relations of the thought.
* pg 26: A likeness of form enables the reader to recognize more readily any likeness of content and function.
* pg 27: When words requiring particular prepositions join in compound construction, all these prepositions must be included, unless they are all the same.
* pg 27: Correlative expressions (_both, and_; _not, but_; _not only, but also_; _either, or_; _first, second_) should be followed by the same grammatical construction.
* pg 28: Bring together words and groups of words that are related in thought, and keep apart those that are not so related.
* pg 29: The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not be separated by a phrase or clause that can be moved to the beginning.
* pg 29: The relative pronoun, such as _who_, _whom_, _whoever_, _whomever_, _whose_, _that_, or _which_, should immediately follow its antecedent.
* pg 30: Modifiers should come next to the words they modify. If several expressions modify the same word, rearrange so that no wrong relation is suggested.
* pg 31: Keep summaries to one tense; shifting between tenses gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution.
* pg 32: The proper place for the word or group of words that the writer wants to make most prominent is at the end.
* pg 33: Any element in the sentence other than the subject becomes emphatic when placed first.

### III. A Few Matters of Form
* pg 34: Use colloquialisms or slang without quotation marks or drawing attention to it.
* pg 34: When two or more words are combined to form a compound adjective, a hyphen is usually required.
* pg 36: Formal quotations cited as documentary evidence are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks.
* pg 37: Provide references in parentheses or footnotes. Omit words _book_, _volume_, _page_ except when referring to only one of them.
* pg 38: Omit _A_ or _The_ from titles when you place the possessive before them.

### IV. Words and Expressions Commonly Misused
* pg 39: _Aggravate_ is to add to an already troublesome matter; _irritate_ is to vex or annoy.
* pg 40: When more than two are involved but each is considered individually, _between_ is preferred over _among_.
* pg 40: Replace _and/or_ by using _or_ and appending _or both_.
* pg 41: Replace _as to whether_ with _whether_, _regarded as being_ with _regarded as_, and _as yet_ with _yet_ if equivalent.
* pg 42: Drop _case_, such as in _in many cases_ or _been the case_, as well as _certainly_.
* pg 43: Use _compare to_ to highlight similarities in different things, and _compare with_ to highlight differences in similar things.
* pg 43: A collective is _comprised_ of many things, while many things _constitute_ a collective.
* pg 44: One thing differs from another, and so use _different from_ instead of _different than_.
* pg 45: _Each and every one_ is pitchman's jargon and should be avoided.
* pg 45: Use _enormity_ in the sense of "monstrous wickedness." It is misleading, if not wrong, to use to express bigness.
* pg 46: Using _etc_ is incorrect at the end of a list introduced by _such as_ or _for example_. In formal writing, _etc_ is a misfit.
