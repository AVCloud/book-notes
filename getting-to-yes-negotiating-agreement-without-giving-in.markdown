## Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In

by Roger Fisher and William Ury

#### Introduction

* Negotiating is a basic means of getting what you want from others. It is back-and-forth communication designed to reach an agreement when some interests are shared and others are opposed.
* Conflict is a growth industry. Everyone wants to participate in decisions that affect them, and fewer and fewer people will accept decisions made by someone else.
* A soft negotiator wants to avoid personal conflict. He or she will make concessions readily to reach agreement, and so will end up exploited and feeling bitter.
* A hard negotiator takes more extreme positions and holds out longer. That exhausts both himself or herself and his or her resources, and harms the relationship with the other side.
* The *Principled negotiation* method looks for gains wherever possible, and where interests conflict, to insist that the result be based on some fair standards independent of the will of either side.
* Principled negotiation is an all-purpose strategy. Unlike almost other strategies, if the other side learns this one, it becomes easier to use rather than harder.

#### Don't Bargain Over Positions

* A wise agreement is one that meets the legitimate interests of each side to the extent possible, resolves conflicting interests fairly, is durable, and takes community into account.
* Any method of negotiation should be fairly judged by three criteria: It should produce a wise agreement if possible, it should be efficient, and it should be amicable.
* Negotiating over a position leads to lock-in, as the more you clarify your position and defend it against attack, the more committed you become to it. Your ego becomes identified with the position.
* The more attention is paid to positions, the less attention is devoted to meeting the underlying concerns of the parties.
* If an agreement is reached with positional bargaining, it may reflect a mechanical splitting of the difference between final positions, rather than a solution crafted to meet any legitimate interests.
* Extreme positions, small concessions, and the large number of individual decisions regarding what to offer, what to reject, and what to concede, make positional bargaining highly inefficient.
* Moreover, positional bargaining strains and sometimes shatters relationships, and is even worse when there are more than two parties involved.
* Soft positional bargaining may be efficient, but the agreement may not be wise. Moreover, you are vulnerable to domination by someone who plays a hard game of positional bargaining.
* The game of negotiation takes place at two levels: At one level it addresses the substance; at another, it focuses, usually implicitly, on the procedure for dealing with the substance.
* Each move you make within a negotiation not only deals with a substantive question, but it helps structure the rules of the game that you are playing. It is a meta-game.
* Principled negotiation, or negotiation on the merits, can be boiled down to focusing on people, interests, options, and criteria.
* For *people*: separate the people from the problem. Participants should see themselves as working side-by-side, attacking the problem and not each other.
* For *interests*: Focus on interests, not positions. Compromising between positions will not produce an agreement that will take care of the human needs that led people to adopt those positions.
* For *options*: Before trying to reach an agreement, invent options for mutual gain. Set aside time for thinking of solutions that advance shared interests and creatively reconcile differing interests.
* For *criteria*: Insist on using objective criteria. If a party is being stubborn, counter by insisting that the agreement must reflect some fair standard independent of the naked will of either side.
* The time in which these four propositions of principled negotiation are in play can be broken down into three stages: analysis, planning, and discussion.
* The analysis stage is when you gather information; the planning stage is when you generate ideas about what to do; the discussion stage is when options can be generated and agreement reached.
