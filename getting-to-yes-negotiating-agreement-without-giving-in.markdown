## Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In

by Roger Fisher and William Ury

#### Introduction

* Negotiating is a basic means of getting what you want from others. It is back-and-forth communication designed to reach an agreement when some interests are shared and others are opposed.
* Conflict is a growth industry. Everyone wants to participate in decisions that affect them, and fewer and fewer people will accept decisions made by someone else.
* A soft negotiator wants to avoid personal conflict. He or she will make concessions readily to reach agreement, and so will end up exploited and feeling bitter.
* A hard negotiator takes more extreme positions and holds out longer. That exhausts both himself or herself and his or her resources, and harms the relationship with the other side.
* The *Principled negotiation* method looks for gains wherever possible, and where interests conflict, to insist that the result be based on some fair standards independent of the will of either side.
* Principled negotiation is an all-purpose strategy. Unlike almost other strategies, if the other side learns this one, it becomes easier to use rather than harder.
