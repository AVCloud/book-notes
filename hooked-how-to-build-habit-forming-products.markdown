## Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products

by Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover

#### Introduction

* Today, amassing millions of users is not good enough. Companies find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits that they create. They must understand what makes makes users click, and what makes them tick.
* Habit-forming companies link their services to users' daily routines and emotions. They are a "first-to-mind" solution. You must manufacture these habits.
* Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external *triggers* like email, a website link, or the app icon on a phone. 
* The next step is the *action*, or behavior done in anticipation of the reward. Companies increase the likelihood of action by making it easy and tapping into our psychological motivation to do it.
* The next step is the *reward*. Making the reward variable suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason, and activates the parts associated with wanting and desire.
* The final step is *investment*, where the user puts something into the product such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money. It implies an action that improves the service for the next go-around.

#### Ch 1: The Habit Zone

* Habits give us the ability to focus our attention on other things by storing automatic responses.
* Fostering customer habits is an effective way to increase the value of a company by driving higher customer lifetime value, and a business is worth the sum of its future profits.
* As customers form routines around a product, they depend on it and become less price-sensitive. See free-to-play video games, where developers delay asking for money until the user plays consistently and habitually.
* Hooked users become brand evangelists. When this happens, the most important factor to increasing growth is the "Viral Cycle Time," which is the amount of time it takes a user to invite another user.
* John Gourville, a professor of marketing at HBS, says that "many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new." 
* Products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial. Because old habits die hard.
* Non-transferable value created and stored inside a service discourages a user from leaving.
* New behaviors have a short shelf-life. The habits that we've most recently acquired are also the ones that are likely to go soonest.
* Frequent engagement with a product, especially over a short period of time, increases the likelihood of forming new routines.
* For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain.
* A behavior that occurs with high frequency but less utility, or an app that occurs with low frequency but more utility, has habit-forming potential.
* Habit-forming services seem, at first, to be offering nice-to-have vitamins, but once the habit is established, they provide an ongoing pain remedy.
* Addictions are self-destructive. A habit is a behavior that can have a positive influence on a person's life, but can be healthy or unhealthy.

#### Ch 2: Trigger

* External triggers are embedded with information, which tells the user what to do next.
* An external trigger presenting multiple choices can cause hesitation, confusion, or worse, abandonment. Fewer choices increases the likelihood of the desired behavior occurring unconsciously.
* External triggers include *paid* triggers, *earned* triggers, *relationship* triggers, and *owned* triggers.
* Since paying for re-engagement is unsustainable, companies generally use paid triggers to acquire new users and then leverage other triggers to bring them back.
* Earned triggers require time spent on public and media relations. Awareness generated is short-lived, so to drive ongoing user acquisition, companies must perpetually keep their products in the limelight.
* Relationship triggers require building an engaged user base that is enthusiastic about sharing the benefits of the product with others. They can create the viral growth entrepreneurs and investors lust after.
* Employing dark patterns may lead to some initial growth, but it comes at the expense of the social currency of users, including their goodwill and trust.
* Owned triggers consistently show up in daily life and it is ultimately up to the user to opt into allowing these triggers to appear. They prompt repeat engagement until a habit is formed.
* When a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a pre-existing routine, it leverages an internal trigger. Unlike external triggers, you can't see, touch, or hear them.
* Negative emotions like boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness can serve as internal triggers: They instigate pain or irritation and mindless action to quell the negative sensation.
* In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.
* To design a product, we must know users' internal triggers, or the pain they seek to solve. But asking to users to reveal these wants is ineffective, since users don't know which emotions motivate them.
* The "5 Whys Method," used by Toyota, asks to ask the question "why" as many times as it takes to reach an emotion explaining why someone uses a product. This usually happens by the fifth "why."
