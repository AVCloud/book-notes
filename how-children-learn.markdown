### Learning About Children

* A particular skill is not "located" in any one part of your brain, but you can say that one part of your brain is critical to carrying out a particular skill.
* It is difficult to separate what we think about something from what we feel about it.
* We cannot learn how children normally operate in experiments performed under artificial or even threatening circumstances.
* It is only in the presence of loving, respectful, trusting adults that children will learn all they are capable of learning, or reveal to us what they are learning.

### Games & Experiments

* Carl Orff showed that when children are given many opportunities to improvise, to make up their own chants, rhythms, and tunes, their musical and verbal growth can be very rapid.
* A child has no stronger desire than to make sense of the world, to move freely in it, and to imitate bigger people. So there must be something very strong with much of what we do in school if we feel the need to worry so much about "motivation."
* Keeping children from touching anything that is not theirs dampers their confidence. Instead we should teach children to treat objects carefully, use them as they are meant to be used, and to put the objects back where they belong.
* It must be exciting for a child, playing a game with an adult, to feel that by doing a certain thing, he can make that omnipotent giant do something, and that he can keep this up for as long as he likes.
* Very young children have what we could call an Instinct of Workmanship. They want to do something as well as they can, not to please someone else but to please themselves.
* Children don't seem to be born fearful of things. They learn what to fear from their elders.
* Children, especially young ones, are very sensitive to emotion. They not only catch everything they feel, but blow it up to a larger-than-life size.
* Children are cruel to each other, but they become distressed if near another child who is badly hurt or very unhappy. Few children are capable of the kind of sustained, deliberate cruelty so often shown by adults.
* All children want and strive for increased mastery and control of the world around them, and all are to some degree humiliated, threated, and frightened by finding out that they don't have it.
* The word *no*, for a two-year old, is the Declaration of Independence and the Magna Carta rolled into one.
* To many four-year olds, doing a puzzle is only a means to an end, namely gaining the approval of the teacher or of each other. To a younger child, not in a very competitive or status-conscious situation, such a task is an end in itself.
* It's useless to urge on people who are down; that just frightens or discourages them more. Instead we must draw them back, take off the pressure, reassure them, console them, and give them time to regain enough energy and courage to go back to the task.
* The best games with children flow easily and naturally from the situation of the moment, and we must be ready to give up a game instantly and without regret if the child is not enjoying it.
* Children find it fun to do something wrong that they know how to do right. Adults tend to discourage it, but we should enjoy and encourage it, as it is not always necessary to be right.
* Children can use the scientific method, or the selective use of trial and error, to find something out, and are even conscious of using it.
* When more people were craftsmen, children could easily learn by watching them. Now this is more difficult, because most work is not work as a child could understand it, and much work is now done by machines.
* When a game teaches how something works, it also teaches that many actions have regular and predictable effects, and that the world is in many ways a sensible and trustworthy place.
* Children resist unasked-for teaching because they hear in it the (perhaps unconscious) message, "You're not smart enough to see that this is important to learn, and even if you were, you're not smart enough to learn it."
* Children will ask for help if they need it. But sending them messages of doubt and distrust may destroy their confidence in their ability to learn for themselves, and convince them that they are too lazy, incurious, and stupid to learn.
* One of the many great advantages of home-schooled education is that children have a chance to see their parents and other adults work, and to join in if they wish.
* When playing with an instrument or machine for the first time, children must pile up quite a mass of raw sensory data before they can begin trying to sort it out and how to make sense of it.
* A trained scientist asks nature a question and then cuts the noise of information to a minimum. But to a child in a strange world, everything is noise, and until he has a great deal of data, he has no idea what questions to ask or what questions there are to be asked.
* Consequently, children are better able to tolerate confusing data, to pick out its patterns. They are also less likely to make fast conclusions on the basis of too little data, or after having made such conclusions, to refuse to consider new and contradictory data.
