### Chapter 1: How To Fail (And How Not To)

* pg 5: You can't expect to solve the problems of a school without taking into account what's happening in the community.
* pg 9: Many problems we generally think of as social issues are best analyzed and addressed on the molecular level, down deep in the realm of human biology.
* pg 10: The ACE study demonstrated a stunning correlation between adverse childhood experiences and negative adult outcomes.
* pg 11: The study also found that such experiences had a profound negative effect on adult health even when self-destructive behaviors like heavy drinking, overeating, and smoking weren't present.
* pg 12: Our stress-response system, or the HPA axis, evolved to react to brief and acute stress. Turning it on for months on end is highly destructive.
* pg 13: Managing stress is called *allostasis*. The gradual breaking down of your stress management systems is called *allostatic load*.
* pg 13: The HPA axis can't distinguish between different types of threat, so it activates every defense, all at once, in response to any threat.
* pg 16: Doctors are trying to create an allostatic-load index as a biological-risk indicator, similar to blood pressure.
* pg 17: Early stress affects the prefrontal cortex, which is critical in self-regulatory activities of all kinds. Consequently, children who grow up in stressful environments have more learning or behavioral problems.
* pg 18: The prefrontal cortex also dictates executive functions, which refer to the ability to deal with confusing and unpredictable situations and information. Students must do this all the time.
* pg 19: Whether you're utilizing self-control in the emotional realm or in the cognitive realm, that ability is crucial to getting through a school day.
* pg 20: Poverty doesn't compromise the executive function abilities of poor children -- it's the stress that goes along with poverty.
* pg 21: This was encouraging, as the prefrontal cortex is mores responsive to intervention than other parts of the brain, and remains flexible through early adulthood.
* pg 22: The incentive processing system reaches full power in early adolescence, while the cognitive control system that keeps it in check doesn't finish maturing until you're in your twenties.
* pg 28: Parents and other caregivers who form nurturing relationships with their children can foster resilience that protects them from many of the worst effects of a harsh environment.
* pg 30: Rats that were licked and groomed as children were smarter, more social, more curious, less aggressive, had better self-control, were healthier, and lived longer.
* pg 31: Licking and grooming affixes certain chemicals to a pup's DNA, a process called methylation, and so subtle parenting behaviors had predictable and long-lasting DNA-related effects.
* pg 33: In 1950s, behaviorists thought you should not "spoil" infants by picking them or up or otherwise comforting them when they cried.
* pg 34: Attachment theory showed that the effect of early nurturance was the opposite, creating a "secure base" from which a child could explore the world.
* pg 35: Children with "secure attachment" early on were shown to be more socially competent throughout their lives.
* pg 38: If a new mother experienced "insecure attachment" with her parents at a child, it will be more difficult to create secure attachment for her child without help.
* pg 40: Intervention with parents alone can create in their children secure attachment and shift their cortisol patterns from dysfunctional to normal.
* pg 41: Anxiety-producing parenting can be undone with a relatively minor intervention, unlike previous early-childhood interventions that focused on the importance of early language skills.
* pg 48: Pure IQ is stubbornly resistant to improvement after age 8, but executive functions and the ability to handle stress and manage strong emotions can be improved well into adolescence.
