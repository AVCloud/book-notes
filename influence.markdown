## Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion

by Robert B. Cialdini, Ph.D.

#### Ch 1: Weapons of Influence

* In many species, a *trigger feature*, or one tiny aspect of something, will cue a *fixed-action pattern*, or a regular and blindly mechanical response.
* As an example of a parallel form of human automatic action, when we ask someone to do us a favor, we will be more successful if we provide a reason. Regardless of the reason.
* We need automatic and stereotyped behavior. We don't have the time or energy or capacity to recognize and analyze all aspects in all people, events, or situations.
* British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead asserted that "civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them."
* We know very little about our automatic behavior patterns, but they make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who knows how they work.
* One can trigger the great stores of influence that already exist in a situation and direct them toward the target, and thereby manipulate without the appearance of manipulation.
* The contrast principle states that if a second item is fairly different from the first, then we will tend to see it as more differently than it actually is.
* Therefore it is more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first; not doing so will actually cause the principle to work against them.

#### Ch 2: Reciprocation

* By virtue of the rule of reciprocation, we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like. We even use "much obliged" as a synonym for "thank you."
* We can give away resources without actually giving them away, thereby lowering the natural inhibitions against transactions that must be begun by one person's providing personal resources to another.
* Human societies derive a significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule, and consequently ensure their members are trained to comply and believe in it.

##### The Rule Is Overpowering

* The rule is so strong that it simply overwhelms the influence of other factors that normally affects the decision to comply, such as whether one actually likes the other person.
* A promoter who gives free samples can release the natural indebting force inherent in a gift while innocently appearing to have only the intention to inform.

##### The Rule Enforces Uninvited Debts

* Another person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an unwanted favor. The obligation to receive makes this easy to exploit.
* Free gifts through the mail solicit money as a "return offering" and not as payment, because there is a strong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even if unwanted.

##### The Rule Can Trigger Unfair Exchanges

* The rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor and the nature of the debt-canceling return favor, and so it can encourage an unfair exchange.
* Small favors can stimulate larger return favors because being in a state of obligation feels highly disagreeable, and society dislikes those who don't conform to the reciprocity rule.
* People will avoid asking for a needed favor if they will not be in a position to repay it.

##### RECIPROCAL CONCESSIONS

* Another consequence of the rule is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.
* We reciprocate concessions because it is in the interests of any human group to have its members working toward the achievement of common goals, usually through compromise.
* If there were no social obligation to reciprocate a concession, no one would want to make the first sacrifice. But the rule allows us to make the first sacrifice safely.
* The rejection-then-retreat technique is to ask a larger request that the other party will turn down, and then make the smaller request that you were interested in all along.
* The second request does not actually have to be a small request. It can be objectively large, as long as it is smaller than the first request.
* If a party makes an extreme request, then they are not seen as bargaining in good faith. Any retreat from that position is not viewed as a concession, and is therefore not reciprocated.
* A gifted negotiator takes an initial position that is exaggerated but not viewed as illegitimate, and allows for multiple reciprocal concessions that yield a desirable final offer.
* The rejection-than-retreat also employs the contrast principle. The concession will also look like a smaller request than if one had just asked for it straight away.
* The tactic also spurs people not only to agree to a desired request but actually to carry out the request and, finally, to volunteer to perform further requests.
* A requester's concession causes the target to feel more responsible for having "dictated" the final agreement, and therefore responsible for living up to the terms of that agreement.
* Forging an arrangement through concessions is also satisfying. A party that is satisfied with an arrangement is more likely to be willing to agree to future such arrangements.

##### HOW TO SAY NO

* Declining the requester's first offer is not a good strategy, for you cannot assess whether it is honest or the initial step in an exploitation attempt.
* By default, accept the gift and engage in the "honored network of obligation" that has served humanity so well, until you realize that it is a tactic for compliance.
* Upon being confronted with a compliance tactic, mentally redefine the initial offering as a weapon of that tactic, and you will free yourself from the reciprocity rule.

#### Ch 3: Commitment and Consistency

* Once we have made a decision, we will encounter personal or interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with it, and consequently respond in ways that justify it.
* The drive to be and look consistent constitutes a highly potent weapon of social influence, often causing us to act in ways which are clearly contrary to our own best interests.
* Inconsistent people are seen as indecisive, confused, two-faced, or even mentally ill. Consistent people are seen as having personal and intellectual strength.
* Maintaining consistency means we don't have to think hard about an issue anymore, letting us cope with complex environments that make demands on our mental energies and capacities.
* Furthermore, automatic consistency can supply a safe hiding place from disturbing things that we would rather not realize.
* Exploiters can structure their interactions with us so that our own need to be consistent with lead directly to their benefit.

##### COMMITMENT IS THE KEY

* Once someone makes a commitment, or takes a stand or goes on record, then there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with that commitment.
* Many salespeople use the "foot-int-the-door" technique, or obtain a large purchase by starting with a small one. The purpose of this small one is not profit, but commitment.
* Making a small agreement can also change our self-image, which in turn increases our willingness to comply with larger requests that are only remotely connected to the small one.
* Once you have a man's self image where you want it, he should comply naturally with a whole range of requests that are consistent with his view of himself.

##### The Magic Act

* Our behavior informs us about ourselves; it is a primary source of information about our beliefs and values and attitudes.
* A written statement is not just a lasting personal reminder of one's action, but is also likely to persuade those around him that his statement reflected his actual beliefs.
* What those around us think is true is enormously important for what we ourselves think is true.

##### The Public Eye

* Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments. And the more public the commitment, the more reluctant we will be to change it.

##### The Effort Extra

* Written commitments require more effort than verbal ones. And the more effort goes into a commitment, the greater its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it.
* Persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort.
* This applies to any effortful and troublesome initiation rite, where the loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase the chances of group cohesion and survival.

##### The Inner Choice

* We accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong outside pressures, such as a large reward or strong threat.
* Consequently, we must arrange for our children to accept inner responsibility for the actions that we want them to take, and not heavily bribe or threaten them for compliance.
* Once we have made a commitment, we find new reasons that support or justify our commitment.
* The "lowball technique" is to induce a commitment, wait for the commitment to stand on its own with the help of these new reasons, and then remove the inducement.
* If the lowball technique is used for good, then removing the inducement may even heighten the commitment by a person, as he or she can now fully own the commitment.

##### HOW TO SAY NO

* When your stomach tells you that you would be a sucker to make a commitment simply because it would be consistent with a prior commitment, relay that message to the requester.
* We may experience true feelings about something a split second before we can intellectualize, or even rationalize, about it. This is the signal from our heart of hearts.
