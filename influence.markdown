## Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion

by Robert B. Cialdini, Ph.D.

#### Ch 1: Weapons of Influence

* In many species, a *trigger feature*, or one tiny aspect of something, will cue a *fixed-action pattern*, or a regular and blindly mechanical response.
* As an example of a parallel form of human automatic action, when we ask someone to do us a favor, we will be more successful if we provide a reason. Regardless of the reason.
* We need automatic and stereotyped behavior. We don't have the time or energy or capacity to recognize and analyze all aspects in all people, events, or situations.
* British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead asserted that "civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them."
* We know very little about our automatic behavior patterns, but they make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who knows how they work.
* One can trigger the great stores of influence that already exist in a situation and direct them toward the target, and thereby manipulate without the appearance of manipulation.
* The contrast principle states that if a second item is fairly different from the first, then we will tend to see it as more differently than it actually is.
* Therefore it is more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first; not doing so will actually cause the principle to work against them.
