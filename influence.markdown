## Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion

by Robert B. Cialdini, Ph.D.

#### Ch 1: Weapons of Influence

* In many species, a *trigger feature*, or one tiny aspect of something, will cue a *fixed-action pattern*, or a regular and blindly mechanical response.
* As an example of a parallel form of human automatic action, when we ask someone to do us a favor, we will be more successful if we provide a reason. Regardless of the reason.
* We need automatic and stereotyped behavior. We don't have the time or energy or capacity to recognize and analyze all aspects in all people, events, or situations.
* British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead asserted that "civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them."
* We know very little about our automatic behavior patterns, but they make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who knows how they work.
* One can trigger the great stores of influence that already exist in a situation and direct them toward the target, and thereby manipulate without the appearance of manipulation.
* The contrast principle states that if a second item is fairly different from the first, then we will tend to see it as more differently than it actually is.
* Therefore it is more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first; not doing so will actually cause the principle to work against them.

#### Ch 2: Reciprocation

* By virtue of the rule of reciprocation, we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like. We even use "much obliged" as a synonym for "thank you."
* We can give away resources without actually giving them away, thereby lowering the natural inhibitions against transactions that must be begun by one person's providing personal resources to another.
* Human societies derive a significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule, and consequently ensure their members are trained to comply and believe in it.

##### The Rule Is Overpowering

* The rule is so strong that it simply overwhelms the influence of other factors that normally affects the decision to comply, such as whether one actually likes the other person.
* A promoter who gives free samples can release the natural indebting force inherent in a gift while innocently appearing to have only the intention to inform.

##### The Rule Enforces Uninvited Debts

* Another person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an unwanted favor. The obligation to receive makes this easy to exploit.
* Free gifts through the mail solicit money as a "return offering" and not as payment, because there is a strong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even if unwanted.

##### The Rule Can Trigger Unfair Exchanges

* The rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor and the nature of the debt-canceling return favor, and so it can encourage an unfair exchange.
* Small favors can stimulate larger return favors because being in a state of obligation feels highly disagreeable, and society dislikes those who don't conform to the reciprocity rule.
* People will avoid asking for a needed favor if they will not be in a position to repay it.

##### RECIPROCAL CONCESSIONS

* Another consequence of the rule is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.
* We reciprocate concessions because it is in the interests of any human group to have its members working toward the achievement of common goals, usually through compromise.
* If there were no social obligation to reciprocate a concession, no one would want to make the first sacrifice. But the rule allows us to make the first sacrifice safely.
* The rejection-then-retreat technique is to ask a larger request that the other party will turn down, and then make the smaller request that you were interested in all along.
* The second request does not actually have to be a small request. It can be objectively large, as long as it is smaller than the first request.
* If a party makes an extreme request, then they are not seen as bargaining in good faith. Any retreat from that position is not viewed as a concession, and is therefore not reciprocated.
* A gifted negotiator takes an initial position that is exaggerated but not viewed as illegitimate, and allows for multiple reciprocal concessions that yield a desirable final offer.
* The rejection-than-retreat also employs the contrast principle. The concession will also look like a smaller request than if one had just asked for it straight away.
* The tactic also spurs people not only to agree to a desired request but actually to carry out the request and, finally, to volunteer to perform further requests.
* A requester's concession causes the target to feel more responsible for having "dictated" the final agreement, and therefore responsible for living up to the terms of that agreement.
* Forging an arrangement through concessions is also satisfying. A party that is satisfied with an arrangement is more likely to be willing to agree to future such arrangements.

##### HOW TO SAY NO

* Declining the requester's first offer is not a good strategy, for you cannot assess whether it is honest or the initial step in an exploitation attempt.
* By default, accept the gift and engage in the "honored network of obligation" that has served humanity so well, until you realize that it is a tactic for compliance.
* Upon being confronted with a compliance tactic, mentally redefine the initial offering as a weapon of that tactic, and you will free yourself from the reciprocity rule.
