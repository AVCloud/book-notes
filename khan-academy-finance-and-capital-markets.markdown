### Interest and debt

#### Compound interest basics

* The rule of 72 answers how long to double your money if compounding annually.
* For example, if compounding 10% annually, then it will take 72/10 = 7.2 years. If compounding 6% annually, then it will take 72/6 = 12 years.
* For lower interest rates, the rule of 72 slightly overestimates how long it will take to double your money. For higher interest rates, it slightly underestimates.

#### Interest basics

* Interest is just rent on money.
* The original amount that is borrowed, or on which interest is charged, is simply called the principal.
* Simple interest is the opposite of compound interest. If you think about it, you're paying a smaller and smaller percentage of what you owe going into that year.
* Given a principal P and an interest rate r, simple interest adds Pr every year, while compound interest multiplies the existing amount by 1+r.
* APR is annual percentage rate. Another number to look for is the daily periodic rate. Many APRs are calculated as the daily periodic rate multiplied by 365.
* The effective APR imposes compound interest on the daily periodic rate, and is much higher than the advertised APR.

#### Credit cards and loans

* Processors are the people that maintain the credit card network, such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.
* Say a bank wants to issue a credit card to extend credit, earn interest, and make fees. They ask to be a member of the processors' network.
* For a merchant to accept a credit card for a given network, it must have a relationship with a bank that is on that network. That is called the merchant bank, or the acquiring bank, or the acquirer.
* This bank is called the acquirer because it goes out and acquires members to be a part of its network.
* Swiping a credit card goes to the merchant's bank, then to the credit card network, then to the cardholder's bank for authorization.
* When you purchase something from a merchant, the money for what you purchase comes from the bank that issued you the credit card.
* The merchant pays a fee to its acquiring bank, most of which goes upstream to the bank that issued you the credit card. This is called the interchange fee. This is set by the individual networks.
* In the past, usury or usurious meant any kind of interest, but now we associate it with an unreasonable level of interest.

#### Continuous compound interest and e

* If you were to charge 100% interest on a principal of 1 dollar over 1 year, you would calculate that as 1*(1 + 100%/1)^1. Compounding over n intervals, the limit 1*(1 + 100%/n)^n approaches e as n approaches infinity.
* When n approaches infinity, you could view it as continuously compounding every possible fraction of a second.
* When borrowing a principal P over t years, compounding n times per year, at an annual interest rate of r percent, you compound as P*(1 + r/n)^nt. As n approaches infinity, if you substitute x as n/r, then you have P*(1+1/x)^xrt as x approaches infinity, which simplifies as P*e^rt.

#### Present value

* The amount of money is not all that matters. When you get or when you have to give the money also matters. This is called the time value of money.
* To determine what is the present value of some amount of money at some time in the future, you must determine what principal you must have now, earning interest at some specified interest rate.
* To determine the future value of some principal at some specified time in the future, you must compute its interest over that time and add it to the principal.
* Another way to discuss this is: Given some amount of money in the future, to determine its present value, we discount the value by a discount rate.
* When the government borrows from you some amount of money at some specified interest rate, it will always pay back the promised amount, because it can print the money if needed.
* If given a number of choices, each with payments over multiple years, you can determine which is best by totaling the present values of each choice.
* Compounding going forward in time is the same as discounting going backward in time.
* When you lower the interest rate, the present value of a future payment goes up, because you're discounting by a smaller number. The terms that are using that discount rate the most, benefit the most.
* A discounted cash flow is when you have a stream of cash flows, and you are discounting them back to get today's present value.
* There are a lot of assumptions in finance. You can justify any present value by picking the right discount rate. And that discount rate is dependent on risk. This is the crux of modern finance.

#### Personal bankruptcy

* The debtor is the person who borrows money, and now owe money. The creditor is who lent the money, and is owed money.
* Bankruptcy laws are to protect the debtor from being perpetually in debt with no hope of coming out.
* Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 actually apply to chapters of the US bankruptcy code.
* Chapter 7 is straight bankruptcy, in which a trustee or bankruptcy court sells all your assets, splits them among all your creditors, and then you are free of all debt.
* Chapter 7 stays on your credit report for 10 years. And some liabilities, such as certain types of student loans, taxes, child support, and so on cannot be forgiven.
* Chapter 13 is reorganization, in which you create a plan with your creditors to pay them back over the next 3 years. It then shows up on your credit report for the next 7 years.
* If a person does not have a job, then filing for Chapter 13 is not a realistic option, and that person must resort to filing a Chapter 7.

### Inflation

#### Inflation basics

* Measuring inflation is difficult becuase it is based on the cost of a representative "basket of goods and services," but what is in that basket changes over time, e.g. new technology replaces old.
* The basket of goods and services is called a consumer price index, or CPI, and you are measuring its price inflation between two given years. Price inflation is simply referred to as inflation.
* Monetary inflation is inflation purely due to an increase in the money supply. If the increase in the money supply outstrips the productive capacity of a country, it can lead to price inflation.
* With inflation, each dollar is worth less because you can buy less with each dollar. Consequently people have less purchasing power.
* The Bureau of Labor Statistics is responsible for creating the CPI. The Table A is the percent changes in CPI for all urban consumers, or the CPI-U.
* Changes in inflation between months are seasonally adjusted, e.g. it considers if people use a different amount of energy or a different amount of gasoline between one month and the next.
* In addition to a total inflation number, food and energy are typically also subtracted out since they represent a large portion of the basket and are highly volatile.
* The Case-Shiller index is arguably the best index for recording the actual increases or decreases in prices of holmes.

#### Inflation scenarios

* In a good economy, employment is up, so employees have more negotiating power, and wages go up. So demand goes up, and companies' and services' utilization goes up, and their profit goes up. If they near full utilization, they can invest more, or increase prices.
* More investment and more utilization will increase supply, which can inhibit price. But increased utilization, investment, and profit will lead to more employment, thus completing a loop.
* Stagflation is when you have inflation while you also have stagnation in the economy.
* A supply shock is something like an embargo. Supply decreases, so price increases and thereby causes an inflation, so demand decreases, which in turn decreases utilization and investment and profit, and so employment decreases.
* Hyperinflation is typically when a government prints too much money, leading to prices going up, which requires printing more money to support that.
* When hyperinflation happens, money is less worth every hour, so people instead choose to hoard hard assets. So merchants hold their own supply, which increases prices even more, and so prices increase even more.

#### Real and nominal return

* The nominal return is the actual return divided by your original principal. The real return is the actual return divided by the principal, adjusted for inflation.
* If N is the percent return, I is in the inflation rate, and R is the real return, then you get 1+N = (1+R)(1+I). So compounding by the nominal interest rate equals compounding the real growth by the rate of inflation.

#### Capacity utilization and inflation

* COGS is an acronym for cost of goods sold. Gross profit is calculated as COGS subtracted from revenue. Overhead cost subtracted from gross profit yields operating profit.
* Return on asset is operating income divided by your initial investment.
* Huge returns attracts competition, which in turn attracts capacity, which in turn leads the players to lower their prices in order to increase their utilization.
* When you have high utilization of your asset, there is incentive to raise prices. You will in turn get better return on your asset, and can invest more to build more capacity.
* When you are at low utilization of your asset, there is incentive to lower prices and increase utilization.
* Capacity utilization, whether that is of people or of factories, is what drives inflation. And utilization is a function of demand.
* Normally if the money supply goes up, demand increases. But money is just a vechicle for expressing demand. You can have money but lack desire to spend, such as if your confidence in the economy is low.
* Money supply multiplied by the velocity of money equals the average price of goods multiplied by the total quantity of goods and services that we have.
* Our output is broken down into consumption and savings. Savings turn into an investment; they are two sides of the same coin. This investment, in turn, yields a larger output in the future.
* GDP is all of the goods and services, i.e. all of the income, that we produce. Disposable income is the amount that ends up in the hands of people.
* Up until about 1984, people saved about 10% of their disposable income. Now people save close to 0 of their disposable income. This is because we took on credit and started having "perceived savings."
* Every time we went through a recession from the mid-80s onwards, the government solution as to make financing easier, meaning the fed would lower interest rates and increase available credit.
* When people cannot borrow anymore, they are forced to save. Consequently, demand will decrease by the amount saved, which in turn decreases capacity utilization, and consequently prices.
* When World War II ended, factories were no longer utilized for the war. But Germany, Western Europe, and Japan had their factories bombed, and so their demand picked up the slack from US capacity.
