## Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager

by Michael Lopp

### The Management Quiver

#### 1. Don't Be a Prick

* A great manager is someone with whom you can make a connection no matter where you sit in the organization chart.
* You must _see_ the people who work with you. Constructing an insightful opinion about a person in seconds will make you a phenomenal manager.
* It is your full time job to listen to your employees, to mentally document how they are built, and to fulfill their needs.

#### 2. Managers Are Not Evil

* The what-do-you-do disconnect between employees and managers is at the heart of why employees don't trust their managers, or find them to be evil.
* Run away from any evil manager, or someone who puts themselves before their team, who lie, and who have no ability to lead.
* Because you don't understand what someone else does at your company, you're automatically biased against them. And because you understand your job intimately, you believe it's more important.
* Tell your manager what you do and why it matters. If they aren't an engineer, find a way to speak their language.
* A manager's job is to take the skills that got him promoted, and make them scale. This means building a team to reinforce where he is weak.
* Regardless of the relationship with your manager, you'll speak differently to him than you would to a friend, because he's part of the organization.
* As a manager, you carve out time for regular one-on-ones so that you have a chance to learn.
* Delegation is a slippery slope for managers, because pure delegators are slowly becoming irrelevant to their organizations.
* People who work for pure delegators don't rely on them for work because they can't depend on them for action, which pushes that manager out of the loop.
* Politically active managers may be slimy, but they are informed, and they know when change is afoot and what action to take to best represent their organization.
* The organization's view of your manager is its view of you. Judge his clout when interacting with his superiors, or with his cross-functional peers.
* Your manager is not a manager until he participated in a layoff, or participates in the constructive deconstruction of an organization.
* You want to see who your manager will become because it's often the first time he sees the organization is bigger than the people.
* A successful organization is built of layers of people glued together with managers, who translate between layers in both directions.

#### 3. Stables and Volatiles

* The birth of a 1.0 launch initiates the split of a development team into two groups: Stables and Volatiles.
* Stables happily work with direction, appreciate plans, calmly assess risk and mitigate failure, and tend to generate process.
* Volatiles have issues with authority, seek a thrill in risk, build a lot but nothing stable or beautiful, aren't reliable, and leave a trail of disruption.
* Volatiles turn into Stables by building process and carefully describing how things should be done, because they have the scars and experience.
* These new Stables hire people who are familiar, who are predisposed to be Volatiles, which in turn leads to new disruption.
* A Stable's choice of disruption is within the context of the last war, while a second-generation Volatile will remind you "there is no box."
* As a leader, you need to figure out how to let the Volatiles disrupt, while constantly negotiating a temporary peace treaty with the Stables.

#### 4. The Rands Test

* A growing group needs to continually invest in new ways to figure out what it is collectively thinking, so everyone knows what's going on.
* When shit hits the fan, don't cancel your one-on-one with folks who are responsible, or with folks who can prevent future fan hittage.
* In a team meeting, kill lies, and identify what is broken and start discussing how to fix it.
* The presence of status reports comes down to control, a lack of imagination, and a lack of trust in the organization.
* Be comfortable saying "no" to your boss. If you are always on your best behavior and unwilling to speak your mind, then something is wrong.
* Independently judge whether your company is growing or dying, and develop a defensible opinion regarding the state of the business.
* A regular meeting where everyone can hear the CEO explain his or her vision of the company, and that allows anyone to ask a question, is vital.
* Part of a healthy organization isn't just that information is freely flowing around; it's that people are leveraging it or acting on it.
* Busy feels good, but it is usually tactical and not strategic. Find time in which you're investing in yourself at work.
* In the absence of information, people make shit up, and if they feel threatened, what they make up amplifies their fears. So kill the gossip.
