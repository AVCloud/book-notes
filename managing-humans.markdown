## Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager

by Michael Lopp

### The Management Quiver

#### 1. Don't Be a Prick

* A great manager is someone with whom you can make a connection no matter where you sit in the organization chart.
* You must _see_ the people who work with you. Constructing an insightful opinion about a person in seconds will make you a phenomenal manager.
* It is your full time job to listen to your employees, to mentally document how they are built, and to fulfill their needs.

#### 2. Managers Are Not Evil

* The what-do-you-do disconnect between employees and managers is at the heart of why employees don't trust their managers, or find them to be evil.
* Run away from any evil manager, or someone who puts themselves before their team, who lie, and who have no ability to lead.
* Because you don't understand what someone else does at your company, you're automatically biased against them. And because you understand your job intimately, you believe it's more important.
* Tell your manager what you do and why it matters. If they aren't an engineer, find a way to speak their language.
* A manager's job is to take the skills that got him promoted, and make them scale. This means building a team to reinforce where he is weak.
* Regardless of the relationship with your manager, you'll speak differently to him than you would to a friend, because he's part of the organization.
* As a manager, you carve out time for regular one-on-ones so that you have a chance to learn.
* Delegation is a slippery slope for managers, because pure delegators are slowly becoming irrelevant to their organizations.
* People who work for pure delegators don't rely on them for work because they can't depend on them for action, which pushes that manager out of the loop.
* Politically active managers may be slimy, but they are informed, and they know when change is afoot and what action to take to best represent their organization.
* The organization's view of your manager is its view of you. Judge his clout when interacting with his superiors, or with his cross-functional peers.
* Your manager is not a manager until he participated in a layoff, or participates in the constructive deconstruction of an organization.
* You want to see who your manager will become because it's often the first time he sees the organization is bigger than the people.
* A successful organization is built of layers of people glued together with managers, who translate between layers in both directions.

#### 3. Stables and Volatiles

* The birth of a 1.0 launch initiates the split of a development team into two groups: Stables and Volatiles.
* Stables happily work with direction, appreciate plans, calmly assess risk and mitigate failure, and tend to generate process.
* Volatiles have issues with authority, seek a thrill in risk, build a lot but nothing stable or beautiful, aren't reliable, and leave a trail of disruption.
* Volatiles turn into Stables by building process and carefully describing how things should be done, because they have the scars and experience.
* These new Stables hire people who are familiar, who are predisposed to be Volatiles, which in turn leads to new disruption.
* A Stable's choice of disruption is within the context of the last war, while a second-generation Volatile will remind you "there is no box."
* As a leader, you need to figure out how to let the Volatiles disrupt, while constantly negotiating a temporary peace treaty with the Stables.

#### 4. The Rands Test

* A growing group needs to continually invest in new ways to figure out what it is collectively thinking, so everyone knows what's going on.
* When shit hits the fan, don't cancel your one-on-one with folks who are responsible, or with folks who can prevent future fan hittage.
* In a team meeting, kill lies, and identify what is broken and start discussing how to fix it.
* The presence of status reports comes down to control, a lack of imagination, and a lack of trust in the organization.
* Be comfortable saying "no" to your boss. If you are always on your best behavior and unwilling to speak your mind, then something is wrong.
* Independently judge whether your company is growing or dying, and develop a defensible opinion regarding the state of the business.
* A regular meeting where everyone can hear the CEO explain his or her vision of the company, and that allows anyone to ask a question, is vital.
* Part of a healthy organization isn't just that information is freely flowing around; it's that people are leveraging it or acting on it.
* Busy feels good, but it is usually tactical and not strategic. Find time in which you're investing in yourself at work.
* In the absence of information, people make shit up, and if they feel threatened, what they make up amplifies their fears. So kill the gossip.

#### 5. How to Run a Meeting

* When two people talk, it's a conversation. With three or more, it's a meeting, which needs rules so people know when to talk.
* An alignment meeting are regular meetings with tactical communication exchanges. Creative meetings require diving into solving a hard problem.
* The agenda answers the question of how everyone can get out of a meeting so that they can actually work.
* The referee shapes the meeting to meet the requirements of the agenda and the expectations of the participants.
* The referee must scan for attendees who aren't engaged. If someone is doing anything except listening, then they aren't listening.
* To re-engage someone, ask a question relevant to the current state of the topic, referee silence, or change the scenery.
* As a referee, own the meeting. Summoning the dictator to shut someone down is a last resort, because then everyone may shut down.
* A good referee will improvise, whether letting someone ramble who's onto something, or cutting a meeting short because progress is blocked.
* Meetings must exist, but meetings cannot be seen as the only solution for making progress.

#### 6. The Twinge

* Freshman managers think it's their job to be responsible for their team's every thought and action, but you must learn to delegate.
* You must understand the art of evaluating a Spartan set of data, extracting the truth, and trusting your "Twinges."
* Management is a total career restart, and so approaches you use for products isn't going to work for people.
* As a manager, your day is full of stories. Always be asking if you believe each story, knowing that it's incomplete, and that it supports one point of view.
* Sniffing around pisses people off, and may be interpreted as micromanagement, but it's drawing on your past experiences to find failures, which cause Twinges.
* If you don't keep a story in check with a Twinge, and that story jumps from one person to the next, then you let a lie propagate.
* In summary, listen to stories, map them to your own experience, and ask questions and demand specifics when there is a Twinge.

#### 7. The Update, the Vent, and the Disaster

* Your job in a one-on-one is to give the smallest voice a chance to be heard.
* Always hold a one-on-one at the same time each week; this sends a weekly reminder that you are there for them, no matter how busy.
* Give a one-on-one 30 minutes at least; don't reduce the time because you have so many people working for you, because you work for them.
* Start by asking "how are you?" It's deliberately vague so that the recipient can't help but put themselves in the answer.
* As you listen to a one-on-one, put the person in one of three buckets: the update, the vent, and the disaster.
* A successful one-on-one is not a status report, it is an opportunity to learn something new above the daily grind of business.
* If the one-on-one is a status report, listen twice as hard for something you can discuss, investigate, and explore.
* If that fails, then either come with prepared points, do a mini-performance review, or discuss your own professional disaster.
* Don't confuse a vent for a conversation. They don't want a solution, they want to be heard, and you must listen as long as it takes.
* A vent concludes and you can jump in when the other person loses steam, or it devolves into a rant.
* With a disaster, the worst response is any semblance of emotion. Don't ask questions, just be quiet and let the emotion pass.
* With a disaster, you're not experiencing the problem anymore, but the employee's emotional baggage regarding the problem.
* A disaster is the result of poor management, when someone believes that the only option for catalyzing change is to totally lose their shit.
* A one-on-one is your chance to perform weekly preventative maintenance while also understanding the health of your team.
