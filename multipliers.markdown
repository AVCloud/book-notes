## Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter

by Liz Wiseman

#### Chapter 1: The Multiplier Effect

* pg 5: The person sitting at the apex of the intelligence hierarchy is the genius maker, not the genius.
* pg 12: Multipliers not only access people's current capability, but stretch it, getting more from people than they knew they had to give.
* pg 14: Diminishers argue their people are overworked, the best people are maxed out, and so accomplishing a bigger task requires more resources.
* pg 16: Multipliers argue that most people are underutilized, better leadership can leverage this capability, and so no bigger investment is needed.
* pg 20: A diminisher thinks "They will never figure it out without me," while a multiplier thinks "People are smart and will figure this out."
* pg 21: Multipliers attract and optimize talent, create intensity that requires best thinking, extend challenges, debate decisions, and instill ownership and accountability.
* pg 24: Multipliers have a hard edge, and are not "feel-good" managers. They see a lot, and so they expect a lot.
* pg 25: Multipliers have a great sense of humor. They don't need to defend their own intelligence, and so can see the comedy in error.
* pg 28: In summary, diminishers under-utilize people, while multipliers increase intelligence in others and leverage their resources.
