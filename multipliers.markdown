## Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter

by Liz Wiseman

#### Chapter 1: The Multiplier Effect

* pg 5: The person sitting at the apex of the intelligence hierarchy is the genius maker, not the genius.
* pg 12: Multipliers not only access people's current capability, but stretch it, getting more from people than they knew they had to give.
* pg 14: Diminishers argue their people are overworked, the best people are maxed out, and so accomplishing a bigger task requires more resources.
* pg 16: Multipliers argue that most people are underutilized, better leadership can leverage this capability, and so no bigger investment is needed.
* pg 20: A diminisher thinks "They will never figure it out without me," while a multiplier thinks "People are smart and will figure this out."
* pg 21: Multipliers attract and optimize talent, create intensity that requires best thinking, extend challenges, debate decisions, and instill ownership and accountability.
* pg 24: Multipliers have a hard edge, and are not "feel-good" managers. They see a lot, and so they expect a lot.
* pg 25: Multipliers have a great sense of humor. They don't need to defend their own intelligence, and so can see the comedy in error.
* pg 28: In summary, diminishers underutilize people, while multipliers increase intelligence in others and leverage their resources.

#### Chapter 2: The Talent Magnet

* pg 35: Talent Magnets have a reputation for not only delivering results, but creating a place where young, talented people can grow.
* pg 36: Diminishers operate as Empire Builders, hoarding resources and underutilizing talent, thereby creating disenchantment.
* pg 38: The Talent Magnet has the confidence and magnetism to get A players, who are then stretched into A+ players. These people get recognized and offered new opportunities, giving the organization a reputation as "the place to grow." This attracts more A players.
* pg 40: An Empire Builder has a reputation as a career killer, which is why he or she must labor hard to hoard the resources that he or she has.
* pg 44: Talent Magnets look for talent everywhere. They recognize and appreciate all types of genius, and ignore organizational boundaries because people love to contribute their genius.
* pg 46: They find people's native genius, which is what one does exceptionally well and naturally. And they label it, raising the person's awareness and confidence.
* pg 49: They utilize people at their fullest. They connect people's genius to opportunities that allow it to be used best, and then provide both public and specific praise.
* pg 52: They remove the blockers. They remove the prima donnas that impede organizational smarts, and get out of the way themselves whenever needed.
* pg 56: Empire Builders acquire resources, put people in boxes while being the point of integration, and let talent languish.
* pg 58: Empire Builders have a "one brain, many hands" organizational model. They are costly to organizations, because their portfolio does not increase in value.
* pg 60: Become a genius watcher by identifying a strength and using five whys to find the underlying capabilities; then ask others to test your hypothesis; and finally identify roles to use and expand this genius.
* pg 62: Also remove Diminishers aggressively, as they cause others to operate at only half of their full intelligence and capability.
* pg 63: Talent Magnets encourage people to grow and leave. When people leave, they celebrate their departures and shout their success, which is their best recruiting tool.
