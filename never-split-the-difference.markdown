## Never Split The Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It

by Chris Voss

#### Chapter 1: The New Rules

* No matter how we dress up negotiation in mathematical theories, we still act like animals, driven by our fears, needs, perceptions, and desires.
* The book Getting to Yes assumes that the animalistic, emotional brain could be overcome through a rational, joint problem-solving mindset.
* It focused on separating people from problems, on positions from interests, generating win-win options, and mutually-agreed upon standards for evaluating options.
* Thinking Fast and Slow says our emotional response (System 1) to a suggestion or question informs and creates our logical answer (System 2).
* By affecting a counterpart's System 1 thinking, you can guide his System 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses.
* Emotions and emotional intelligence must be central to an effective negotiation, and not things to overcome.
* The majority of interactions we have at work and at home boil down to a simple, animalistic urge: I want.
* Negotiation is for information gathering and behavior influencing, and includes almost any interaction where someone wants something from somebody else.
* The first step to achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get over your aversion to negotiating.
* Effective negotiation is sizing someone up, influencing their sizing up of you, and using that knowledge to get what you want.
* Negotiation is the heart of collaboration, and is what makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties.

#### Chapter 2: Be a Mirror

* Good negotiators expect surprises; great negotiators use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist.
* Great negotiators question the assumptions that others accept on faith, and thus remain more emotionally open and intellectually agile.
* Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively.
* The goal is to make your counterparts feel safe enough to talk about what they want, and then move on to identify what they actually need.
* But we begin with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety to begin a real conversation.
* Going too fast makes people feel as if they're not being heard, thereby undermining all the rapport and trust that we've built.
* When you slow the process down, you also calm it down.
* It's not what we say, but how we are that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most immediately effective mode of influence.
* A playful voice puts someone in a positive frame of mind, where parties thinking more quickly and are more likely to collaborate and problem solve.
* A late-night FM DJ voice with a downward inflection says you're in control. Inflection in an upward way connotes uncertainty and invites a response.
* Mirroring is an unconscious behavior in which we copy each other to comfort each other, building a kind of rapport that leads to trust.
* Repeat back the critical one to three words of what people say. Your counterpart will elaborate on what was said and sustain the process of connecting.
* To deal with forceful type A personalities, use the late-night FM DJ voice, start with "I'm sorry," mirror, sit in silence, and repeat.
* Use mirroring to elicit the same response as "What do you mean by that?" while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying.
