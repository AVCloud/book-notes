### Object Relational Tutorial

* The SQL Expression Language represents the relational database directly without opinion; the ORM presents a high level and abstracted pattern of usage built upon it.
* The ORM approaches structure and content of data from a user-defined domain model which is transparently persisted and refreshed from its underlying storage model.
* An `Engine` instance is a core interface to the database, adapted to the DBAPI in use.
* The declarative base class maintains a catalog of classes and tables relative to that base.
* SQLAlchemy never makes assumptions about names or characteristics of data; the developer must always be explicit about specific conventions in use.
* The declarative base class has a `metadata` attribute that contains a catalog of all the `Table` objects that have been defined.
* The declarative system supplies a default constructor which accepts keyword arguments of the same name as that of the mapped attributes.
* The `Session` object is just a workspace for your objects, local to a particular database connection.
* Adding an entity to a `Session` does not persist it to the database; this is only done when the session is flushed.
* Using the identity map, once an object with a particular primary key is in a `Session`, all queries for that particular primary key return that object.
* SQLAlchemy by default refreshes data from a previous transaction the first time itâ€™s accessed within a new transaction, so that the most recent state is available.
* The tuples returned by a `Query` object are named tuples, and can be treated much like an ordinary Python object.
* A `Query` object is fully generative, so most method calls return a new `Query` object upon which further criteria may be added.
* The `one()` method of `Query` fully fetches all rows, and if not exactly one object identity or composite row is returned, raises an error.
* The `relationship()` method uses the foreign key relationships between the two tables to determine the nature of this linkage.
* A foreign key constraint in most (though not all) relational databases can only link to a primary key column, or a column that has a `UNIQUE` constraint.
* A foreign key constraint that refers to a multiple column primary key, or a subset of one, and itself has multiple columns, is known as a composite foreign key.
* Objects defined in a relationship use lazy loading by default.
* The `aliased` construct supports aliasing a table with another name so that it can be distinguished against other occurences of that table in a query.
* The `subquery` method returns a SQL expression construct representing a `SELECT` statement embedded in an alias, and behaves like a `Table` construct.
* The `orm.subqueryload()` option is called so because the `SELECT` statement constructed is embedded as a subquery into a `SELECT` against the related table.
* The `orm.joinedload()` option emits a left outer join so that the lead object and the related object or collection is loaded in one step.
* `subqueryload` is appropriate for related collections, while `joinedload` is better suited for many-to-one relationships.
* The `contains_eager()` function is typically most useful for pre-loading the many-to-one object on a query that needs to filter on that same object.
* By default deletes don't cascade; instead you must explicitly specify this when establishing a relationship.
* If a many-to-many relationship has any columns other than foreign keys, you must use the "association object" pattern.

### SQL Expression Language Tutorial

* The expression language allows writing backend-neutral SQL expressions, but does not attempt to enforce that expressions are backend-neutral.
* Table reflection allows "importing" whole sets of `Table` objects automatically from an existing database.
* An `Insert` object does not render bound data in its string form; to see this, call `compile()` and access its `params` attribute.
* SQLAlchemy always returns any newly generated primary key value in a returned `ResultProxy`, regardless of the SQL dialect.
* The `Insert` statement is compiled against the first dictionary in a list of values to insert; subsequent dictionaries must have the same keys.
* Call `close` on a `ResultProxy` object when done to release cursor and connection resources.
* The `Column` type determines how an operator is translated to SQL; for example, a `String` interprets `+` as string concatenation.
* The `label` method produces labels using the `AS` keyword, and allows selecting from expressions that otherwise don't have a name.
