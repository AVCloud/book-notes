## Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard

by Chip Heath and Dan Heath

### Chapter 1: Three Surprises About Change

* The first surprise is that to change a person's behavior, you've got to change that person's situation.
* For individuals' behavior to change, you must influence not only their environment and their hearts and minds. But the heart and mind often disagree.
* Your brain is two systems: The emotional side, which feels pain and pleasure, and the rational side, that deliberates and analyzes.
* We can think of our emotional side as the Elephant, and our rational side as its Rider. When they disagree, the Rider is going to lose.
* But the Elephant gets things done: it provides the drive and energy toward a goal. And the Rider has the weakness of over-analyzing and over-thinking things.
* If you want to change things, you must appeal to both: The Rider provides the planning and direction, while the Elephant provides the energy.
* Self-control is an exhaustible resource. When exhausted, the Rider does not have enough strength to control the Elephant anymore.
* When people try to change things, they're usually tinkering with behaviors that have become automatic, and changing those behaviors requires careful supervision by the Rider.
* The second surprise is that what looks like laziness is often exhaustion. Change is hard because people wear themselves out.
* The third surprise is that what looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. If the Rider isn't sure of what direction to go, he leads the Elephant in circles.
* If you want people to change, you must provide crystal-clear direction. Otherwise the rider will spin his wheels.
* Distilling this into three parts: Direct the Rider, motivate the Elephant, and shape the Path.

### Chapter 2: Find the Bright Spots

* Bright spots, or successes worth emulating, solve the "not invented here" problem, where people have a knee-jerk, skeptical response to imported solutions.
* In situations where change is needed, the Rider can see too many problems and spend too much time sizing them up, thereby dooming the effort.
* Bright spots are your best hope for directing the Rider in such situations when you're trying to bring about change.
* Solutions-focused therapists pose the Miracle Question: "If all your troubles were solved over overnight, what is the first small sign of this that you'd see in the morning?"
* They then pose to the Exception Question: "When is the last time you saw a little bit of the miracle?"
* By answering this question the client is offering up proof that he or she has already solved the problem, even in some circumstances.
* The bright spot philosophy in a single question is to ask yourself, "What is working and how can we do more of it?"
* The Rider's capacity for analysis is endless; even successes can look like problems to an overactive Rider.
* Big problems are typically solved not by big solutions, but by a series of smaller solutions. This asymmetry is why the Rider's analysis can backfire so easily.
* We must ask less of "What's broken, and how can we fix it?" and instead ask "What's working, and how can we do more of it?"
* Our predilection for the negative creates a problem focus for our Rider; by focusing on bright spots we can create a solution focus.
