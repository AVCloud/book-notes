## Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard

by Chip Heath and Dan Heath

### Chapter 1: Three Surprises About Change

* The first surprise is that to change a person's behavior, you've got to change that person's situation.
* For individuals' behavior to change, you must influence not only their environment and their hearts and minds. But the heart and mind often disagree.
* Your brain is two systems: The emotional side, which feels pain and pleasure, and the rational side, that deliberates and analyzes.
* We can think of our emotional side as the Elephant, and our rational side as its Rider. When they disagree, the Rider is going to lose.
* But the Elephant gets things done: it provides the drive and energy toward a goal. And the Rider has the weakness of over-analyzing and over-thinking things.
* If you want to change things, you must appeal to both: The Rider provides the planning and direction, while the Elephant provides the energy.
* Self-control is an exhaustible resource. When exhausted, the Rider does not have enough strength to control the Elephant anymore.
* When people try to change things, they're usually tinkering with behaviors that have become automatic, and changing those behaviors requires careful supervision by the Rider.
* The second surprise is that what looks like laziness is often exhaustion. Change is hard because people wear themselves out.
* The third surprise is that what looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. If the Rider isn't sure of what direction to go, he leads the Elephant in circles.
* If you want people to change, you must provide crystal-clear direction. Otherwise the rider will spin his wheels.
* Distilling this into three parts: Direct the Rider, motivate the Elephant, and shape the Path.
