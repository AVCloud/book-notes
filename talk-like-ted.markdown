## Talk Like TED: The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds

by Carmine Gallo

### Introduction: Ideas Are the Currency of the Twenty-first Century

* If you can't inspire anyone with your ideas, it won't matter how great those ideas are.

### Part 1: Emotional

#### Chapter 1: Unleash the Master Within

* Dig deep to identify your unique and meaningful connection to your presentation topic. Your presentation is nothing without passion.
* Our levels of desire, persistence, and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers.
* Asking yourself "What's my product?" isn't as productive as asking "What business am I really in? What am I passionate about?"
* If your goal of speaking is altruistic, namely giving them information to better their lives, then you'll make a deeper connection and feel more comfortable in your role.
* If you're not having a great time at a great career, it will be harder for you to generate enthusiasm through your presentations.
* Happiness is a choice, an attitude that is contagious, and your state of mind will positively affect the way your listeners perceive you.
* Entrepreneurial passion is a positive, intense feeling that you experience for something that is profoundly meaningful to you as an individual.
* Passionate business leaders are more creative, set higher goals, exhibit greater persistence, and record better company performance.
* Positive emotions, such as passion, enthusiasm, excitement, and optimism, are contagious, lifting the moods of others.
* Positive leaders are perceived as more effective, and are therefore more likely to persuade their followers to do what they want their followers to do.

#### Chapter 2: Master the Art of Storytelling

* Stories stimulate and engage the brain, helping the speaker connect with the audience and making it more likely they will agree with the speaker's point of view.
* A narrative is one of the most powerful ways to break down resistance.
* Data, facts, and analysis challenge people. But narrative gets people comfortable enough to care about the community that you are advocating for.
* Aristotle believed that persuasion occurs when three components are represented: ethos, legos, and pathos.
* Ethos is credibility; logos is the means of persuasion through logic, data, and statistics; pathos is the act of appealing to emotions.
* A story activates language, sensory, visual, and motor areas of the brain; a Powerpoint slide activates only the language-processing center.
* There is always a story to tell, but sometimes you must look hard to find it.
* The first type of story is a personal story. They are an essential trait of authentic leadership, or those who inspire uncommon effort.
* Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge, and so a personal experience that leads to an unexpected result makes for a compelling story.
* The second type of story is that of other people. Such stories can still generate empathy, or recognition and feeling of emotions experienced by someone else.
* The third type of story is about brand success. Successful brands leverage personal stories or characters for success.
* Audiences want to be inspired; they need a hero. Captivate them with stories about yourself, other people, or successful brands.
* A powerful narrative can persuade others that your company, product, or idea can help them achieve the success that they desire.
* When telling a story, use metaphors, analogies, and vivid language, and eliminate cliches, buzzwords, and jargon. Audiences tune out familiar phrases.
* Introduce a hero, or someone that people can root for, and a villain. Cast the villain as a challenge, but not as an actual person or competitor.
