## Talk Like TED: The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds

by Carmine Gallo

### Introduction: Ideas Are the Currency of the Twenty-first Century

* If you can't inspire anyone with your ideas, it won't matter how great those ideas are.

### Part 1: Emotional

#### Chapter 1: Unleash the Master Within

* Dig deep to identify your unique and meaningful connection to your presentation topic. Your presentation is nothing without passion.
* Our levels of desire, persistence, and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers.
* Asking yourself "What's my product?" isn't as productive as asking "What business am I really in? What am I passionate about?"
* If your goal of speaking is altruistic, namely giving them information to better their lives, then you'll make a deeper connection and feel more comfortable in your role.
* If you're not having a great time at a great career, it will be harder for you to generate enthusiasm through your presentations.
* Happiness is a choice, an attitude that is contagious, and your state of mind will positively affect the way your listeners perceive you.
* Entrepreneurial passion is a positive, intense feeling that you experience for something that is profoundly meaningful to you as an individual.
* Passionate business leaders are more creative, set higher goals, exhibit greater persistence, and record better company performance.
* Positive emotions, such as passion, enthusiasm, excitement, and optimism, are contagious, lifting the moods of others.
* Positive leaders are perceived as more effective, and are therefore more likely to persuade their followers to do what they want their followers to do.

#### Chapter 2: Master the Art of Storytelling

* Stories stimulate and engage the brain, helping the speaker connect with the audience and making it more likely they will agree with the speaker's point of view.
* A narrative is one of the most powerful ways to break down resistance.
* Data, facts, and analysis challenge people. But narrative gets people comfortable enough to care about the community that you are advocating for.
* Aristotle believed that persuasion occurs when three components are represented: ethos, legos, and pathos.
* Ethos is credibility; logos is the means of persuasion through logic, data, and statistics; pathos is the act of appealing to emotions.
* A story activates language, sensory, visual, and motor areas of the brain; a Powerpoint slide activates only the language-processing center.
* There is always a story to tell, but sometimes you must look hard to find it.
* The first type of story is a personal story. They are an essential trait of authentic leadership, or those who inspire uncommon effort.
* Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge, and so a personal experience that leads to an unexpected result makes for a compelling story.
* The second type of story is that of other people. Such stories can still generate empathy, or recognition and feeling of emotions experienced by someone else.
* The third type of story is about brand success. Successful brands leverage personal stories or characters for success.
* Audiences want to be inspired; they need a hero. Captivate them with stories about yourself, other people, or successful brands.
* A powerful narrative can persuade others that your company, product, or idea can help them achieve the success that they desire.
* When telling a story, use metaphors, analogies, and vivid language, and eliminate cliches, buzzwords, and jargon. Audiences tune out familiar phrases.
* Introduce a hero, or someone that people can root for, and a villain. Cast the villain as a challenge, but not as an actual person or competitor.

#### Chapter 3: Have a Conversation

* Practice relentlessly and internalize your content so that you can deliver the presentation as comfortably as having a conversation with a close friend.
* True persuasion happens only when you gain your listeners' trust. Voice, gestures, and body language incongruent with your words betrays that trust.
* An authentic presentation takes practice. It requires that your nonverbal communication is consistent with your message.
* To craft and deliver a presentation, get help with planning, receive early feedback, and rehearse in front of others.
* To improve body language and delivery, identify what you are passionate about, and practice until true presence comes to the surface.
* The four elements of verbal delivery are rate, volume, pitch, and pauses.
* Most people slow down their rate of speech when giving a presentation, making them sound unnatural. Talk like you're having a conversation instead.
* The problem with most technical or scientific discussions is that the presenters fail to make the content visual, interesting, or entertaining.
* Truthful and confident people have command presence; their look of authority begins with what they wear and how they carry themselves.
* Great leaders convey a feeling of control despite the circumstances, even if there is no immediate solution.
* Complex thinkers use complex gestures and gestures actually give the audience confidence in the speaker.
* So use gestures, but use the sparingly and only at key moments to reinforce key messages.
* Keep your gestures between your eyes and your belly button. Hands that hang below your navel lack energy and confidence.
* An "eager nonverbal" style has animated, broad, open movements; hand movements openly projected outward; and forward-leaning body positions.
* If you fidget, tap, or jingle, watch a recording of yourself presenting; this makes you better equipped to eliminate useless movements and gestures.
* If you stand still, walk and work the room. Again, record yourself presenting, and ensure that you walk out of frame several times.
* "Power posing" increases testosterone and lowers cortisol levels in the brain, which will make you feel more confident and commanding.
* Fake it until you make it. And then fake it until you become it.
* Delivery and gestures, mastered through practice, will enhance your overall message, but without passion and practice, your presence will be severely diminished.

### Part 2: Novel

#### Chapter 4: Teach Me Something New

* Reveal information that's completely new to your audience, packaged differently, or offers a fresh and novel way to solve a problem.
* The human brain loves novelty, and so an unfamiliar, unusual, or unexpected element intrigues us and jolts us out of preconceived notions.
* As long as you relate your topic to the audience by teaching them something new they can use in their daily lives, you'll hook them, too.
* Making information new and exciting releases dopamine in the listener; this in turn makes the information memorable.
* Sometimes the data you present might not be earthshaking or entirely unfamiliar, but that doesn't mean you can't deliver it in a fresh way.
* The smarter someone is, the more likely they are to be persuaded if you give them a new lens through which to see the world.
* You'll become more interesting if you're interested in learning and sharing ideas from other fields that are much different from your own.
* Great conversations or presentations take you to ideas you'd never considered, instead of ideas that are clich√© or overused.
* In order to force the brain to see things differently, you must find new and novel ways for it to perceive information differently.
* Pay attention to the stories in your life; if they teach you something new and valuable, chances are other people will want to hear about it.
* The Flynn Effect shows that the average IQ scores have increased for each generation wherever such IQ data is available.
* If you can't explain your big idea, or the one thing you want your audience to know, in 140 characters or less, keep working on your message.
* The "Twitter headline" brings clarity to your message and makes it easier for your audience to process the content.
* Cognitive research shows that our brains need to see the big picture before the details.
* The headline should identify what the product, service, or cause is as well as what makes it unique. Do not create a tagline instead.
