by Carmine Gallo

### Introduction: Ideas Are the Currency of the Twenty-first Century

* If you can't inspire anyone with your ideas, it won't matter how great those ideas are.

### Part 1: Emotional

#### Chapter 1: Unleash the Master Within

* Dig deep to identify your unique and meaningful connection to your presentation topic. Your presentation is nothing without passion.
* Our levels of desire, persistence, and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers.
* Asking yourself "What's my product?" isn't as productive as asking "What business am I really in? What am I passionate about?"
* If your goal of speaking is altruistic, namely giving them information to better their lives, then you'll make a deeper connection and feel more comfortable in your role.
* If you're not having a great time at a great career, it will be harder for you to generate enthusiasm through your presentations.
* Happiness is a choice, an attitude that is contagious, and your state of mind will positively affect the way your listeners perceive you.
* Entrepreneurial passion is a positive, intense feeling that you experience for something that is profoundly meaningful to you as an individual.
* Passionate business leaders are more creative, set higher goals, exhibit greater persistence, and record better company performance.
* Positive emotions, such as passion, enthusiasm, excitement, and optimism, are contagious, lifting the moods of others.
* Positive leaders are perceived as more effective, and are therefore more likely to persuade their followers to do what they want their followers to do.
