What makes a badass TL is broken down into three A's: attributes, activities and actions.

#### Attributes

Over time, you should always be increasing three attributes: Knowledge, Speed, and Awareness.

* Knowledge: If work is completed, but waiting to be reviewed, then you should almost always drop your own work and help move it forward.
* Speed: You should strive to be ultra-responsive and capable of making instant decisions, always kicking the ball forward.
* Awareness: You should be able to keep the current state of the entire project in your head at all times. Otherwise, you cannot be aware of potentially imminent blockers.

#### Activities

The two most important things that a tech lead can do also happen to be exact polar opposites: block and unblock.

* Block: The tech lead needs to be alert and aware to what is going on in the project, always ready to jump in and block bad decisions before they are made, typically armed with a better solution. Blocking should not stop progress, it course corrects so things can keep moving. Think harness, not safety net.
* Unblock: If someone has a question, you should be able to either give an answer or bring in the right person to field it.
* Redirect: Mentally build an expert index so you always know where to find an answer. Proactively adding the right individuals to any thread or code review can help increase the overall quality of the work.
* Decide: The faster you can reach a decision, the quicker others can act on it. When you do listen to your instincts, make sure that you're making a robust decision that can stand the test of time. When given a set of options, reduce the number to 2, see if there is a best choice based on experience or data. If not, redirect to someone better suited, or block the decision from being made or unblock it by going with your instinct.
* Show: Have the respect and trust of your team, which is best accomplished by demonstrating that you know your stuff.

#### Actions

There is a long assorted list. Here is an attempt to put its items into buckets:

* Management responsibilities "outward": Say "no" often to new or unnecessary features, vet the product's privacy and security concerns, work with other engineering teams especially on dependencies, etc.
* Management responsibilities "inward": Create and maintain launch and testing and release plans, shield engineers from management, setup team fix-its and hackathons and bug scrubs, escalate blocking issues as necessary, and load-balance work among the team, etc.
* Other management responsibilities: Help create and stack rank project priorities, create target milestone dates and correct and refine them as needed, etc.
* Best technical practices: Define best practices for issue tracking, maintain on-call and onduty processes, and ensure tests are being written for core functionality, etc.
* Team growth: Recruit engineers, review code in detail and give useful feedback, read and write and give feedback on design documents, help onboard, etc.
* Technical action: Identify technical debt, generate new ideas and elegant solutions, debug difficult production issues, write the right code at the right times, etc.
