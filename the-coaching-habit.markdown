## The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever

By Michael Bungay Stanier

#### You Need a Coaching Habit

* Coaching is a leadership style that has positive impact on performance, culture, and the bottom line, but is the least used.
* Coaching lets you break out of three vicious cycles: Creating overdependence, getting overwhelmed, and becoming disconnected.
* By creating overdependence, you disempower others, create frustration for yourself, and make yourself a bottleneck.
* Proliferating priorities makes you lose focus. The more you lose focus, the more overwhelmed you feel. And vice versa.
* Find work that has impact and meaning. Work without real purpose makes us less engaged and motivated, and then we don't find and create Great Work.

#### How to Build a Habit

* The change of behavior required is this: A little more asking questions, and a little less telling people what to do.
* To build an effective habit, you need a reason, a trigger, a micro-habit, effective practice, and a plan.
* Make a vow that's connected to serving others. This connects your payoff to the big picture.
* Identify the trigger of the behavior you want to replace; without this you cannot replace the action that follows it.
* Make your new habit short and specific, or possible in less than 60 seconds. This can be the first step to a bigger habit.
* Practice deeply by practicing small parts of the bigger action, repeating the action, and noticing success and celebrating it.
* Make your habit a resilient system, where when something breaks down, the next step to recover is obvious.
* The new habit formula requires identifying the trigger, identifying the old habit, and defining the new behavior.
* There are just five types of triggers: location, time, emotional state, other people, and the immediately preceding action.
* When adopting coaching, pick someone who might be up for it and will cut you slack, and don't incorporate all ideas at once.
