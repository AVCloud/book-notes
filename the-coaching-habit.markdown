## The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever

By Michael Bungay Stanier

#### You Need a Coaching Habit

* Coaching is a leadership style that has positive impact on performance, culture, and the bottom line, but is the least used.
* Coaching lets you break out of three vicious cycles: Creating overdependence, getting overwhelmed, and becoming disconnected.
* By creating overdependence, you disempower others, create frustration for yourself, and make yourself a bottleneck.
* Proliferating priorities makes you lose focus. The more you lose focus, the more overwhelmed you feel. And vice versa.
* Find work that has impact and meaning. Work without real purpose makes us less engaged and motivated, and then we don't find and create Great Work.

#### How to Build a Habit

* The change of behavior required is this: A little more asking questions, and a little less telling people what to do.
* To build an effective habit, you need a reason, a trigger, a micro-habit, effective practice, and a plan.
* Make a vow that's connected to serving others. This connects your payoff to the big picture.
* Identify the trigger of the behavior you want to replace; without this you cannot replace the action that follows it.
* Make your new habit short and specific, or possible in less than 60 seconds. This can be the first step to a bigger habit.
* Practice deeply by practicing small parts of the bigger action, repeating the action, and noticing success and celebrating it.
* Make your habit a resilient system, where when something breaks down, the next step to recover is obvious.
* The new habit formula requires identifying the trigger, identifying the old habit, and defining the new behavior.
* There are just five types of triggers: location, time, emotional state, other people, and the immediately preceding action.
* When adopting coaching, pick someone who might be up for it and will cut you slack, and don't incorporate all ideas at once.

#### 1: The Kickstart Question

* Small talk might be a useful way to warm up a conversation, but it's rarely a bridge that leads to a conversation that matters.
* Don't begin your coaching conversation with an agenda that was perfect a week ago, but now puts process in front of what really matters.
* Don't avoid a conversation because that feels comfortable, assuming that there's no conversation or question about what the issue is.
* The question "What's on your mind?" quickly turns into a real conversation about the thing that matters most.
* Coaching for performance focuses on specific problems; coaching for development focuses on the person dealing with those problems.
* The 3P model focuses on a project, a person, or a pattern of behavior that is at the heart of a difficulty that the person is working through.
* Projects is where coaching for performance tends to occur. Start here and see whether conversion would benefit from including another P.
* When you're talking about people, you're not talking about them, but your relationship and your role in that relationship.
* Looking at patterns of behavior that you'd like to change is most likely when coaching for development conversations will emerge.
* We are what we give our attention to. The Kickstart Question helps make explicit something that may be unduly influencing the way you work.

#### 2: The AWE Question

* The question "And What Else?" has impact because more options can lead to better decisions, you ask more questions, and you buy yourself time.
* The first answer is never the only answer, and rarely the best answer. Better options lead to better decisions, which lead to better outcomes.
* Giving wrong advice often feels more comfortable than asking a question, as both we and organizations value clarity and certainty.
* And when you're not entirely sure what's going on, and you need a moment to figure things out, the AWE question buys you extra time.
* Use the principles of practicing deeply to ask "And what else?" with genuine interest and curiosity.
* When someone responds "There is nothing else," view that as a sign of success. Move on to another question.
* When it is time to move on, the variation "Is there anything else?" invites closure while producing the same results.
* Don't fall victim to the Paradox of Choice. When the AWE question generates three to five answers, you've made great progress.
* Studies show that follow-up questions that promote higher-level thinking, like the AWE question, deepen understanding and promote participation.

#### 3: The Focus Question

* If you jump in to tackle a presented problem, typically you're working on the wrong problem, doing work your team do, or the work doesn't get done.
* The challenge most people present is not the real challenge; it is a symptom, secondary issue, or ghost of a previous problem.
* Doing the work of others may feel convenient at times, but it will eventually feel overwhelming, and you'll become the bottleneck.
* "What's the real challenge here for you?" slows down the rush to action, so you solve the real problem and not the first problem.
* The question invites analyzing multiple challenges, and makes it personal instead of appealing to high-level or abstract challenges.
* If asking "What's on your mind?" reveals many problems, don't focus on one or offer advice; instead follow up with the focus question.
* You can only coach the person in front of you. Don't tolerate gossip about someone else; ask the challenge question to focus on the relationship.
* If listening to a high-level conversation about "us" and "we" instead of "me" and "I," the focus question can bring focus to the person at hand.
* Adding "for you" to the end of as many questions as possible can make conversations more development- than performance-oriented.
* Remember that there is a place for your advice, however; one of your roles as a manager or leader is to have answers.
* Research shows that adding "for you" to a question helps people figure out the answers faster and more accurately.
