## The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business

by Charles Duhigg

### Prologue: The Habit Cure

* By focusing on just one habit, or a "keystone habit," we can teach ourselves to reprogram other parts of our lives as well.
* Most of the choices we make each day are not the product of well-considered decision making, but are instead habits.
* Habits can be changed if we understand how they work.

### Part One: The Habits of Individuals

#### Ch 1: The Habit Loop: How Habits Work

* If you picture the brain as an onion, then the outside layers are the most recent additions from an evolutionary perspective.
* The outside layers are where the most complex thinking occurs; the inside layers control our automatic behaviors.
* The basal ganglia, near the center, recalls and acts on patterns, storing habits while the rest of the brain goes to sleep.
* Chunking is when the brain converts a sequence of habits into an automatic routine, and is at the root of how habits form.
* Habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.
* An efficient brain makes for a smaller head and therefore easier childbirth, and also allows us to devote mental energy to other tasks.
* Our brain looks for a *cue* to signal which pattern to use. Upon receiving a *reward*, it assesses whether this routine is worth remembering.
* Over time, the cue-routine-reward loop becomes more automatic, and the cue and reward cause anticipation and craving. Eventually a habit is born. 
* Our brain cannot tell the difference between good and bad habits, and so bad habits are always lurking, waiting for the right cues and rewards.
* Without habit loops, our brains would shut down, overwhelmed by the minutiae of daily life.
* It is possible to learn and make unconscious choices without remembering anything about the lesson or decision making.
* By learning to observe the cues and rewards of habit loops, we can change the routines.

#### Ch 2: The Craving Brian: How to Create New Habits

* To cultivate a new habit, create a carving. A craving is what makes cues and rewards work, and what powers the habit loop.
* As a habit becomes stronger, the cue begins eliciting a pleasure response from our brain, thereby creating anticipation and cravings.
* New habits form by putting together a cue, routine, and reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.
* To overpower a habit, we must recognize which craving is driving the behavior. Otherwise we will subconsciously submit to it.
* A cue and reward, on their own, are not enough for a new habit to last; a craving prompted by the cue is always required.
* Think about a reward to create a craving; this will make it easier to endure the routine.
* What we crave doesn't have to have any material benefit, such as tingling from toothpaste or foaming from shampoo.
* Cravings are what drive habits, and figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier.

#### Ch 3: The Golden Rule of Habit Change: Why Transformation Occurs

* It is easier to convince someone to adopt a new behavior if there is something familiar at the beginning and end.
* To change a habit, you must keep the old cue and deliver the old reward, but must insert a new routine.
* To create a new habit you must trigger a new craving; but to change an old habit, you must address an old craving with a new routine.
* Often, we don't really understand the cravings driving our behaviors until we look for them.
* Habit replacement can work well until a stressor appears. But a strong belief can help preserve the reworked habit loop.
* People might be skeptical about their ability to change if they're by themselves, but a community creates belief.
* When people join groups where change seems possible, the potential for that change to occur becomes more real.
* Attacking the behaviors we think of as addictions by modifying the behaviors surrounding them is one of the most effective modes of treatment.

### Part Two: The Habits of Successful Organizations

#### Ch 4: Keystone Habits, or the Ballad of Paul O'Neill: Which Habits Matter Most

* Keystone habits are the habits that matter most when remaking businesses and lives. They start a process that, over time, transforms everything.
* Success doesn't depend on getting every single thing right, but instead relies on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers.
* Exercise, eating with your family, and making your bed, when done habitually, start chain reactions that help other good habits take hold.
* Small wins have an influence disproportionate to the accomplishments of the victories themselves, and are how keystone habits create widespread change.
* They fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.
* The second way keystone habits encourage change by creating structures that help other habits flourish.
* The final way keystone habits encourage widespread change is by creating cultures where new values become ingrained. They make hard choices easier.
* Grit is the tendency to work strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress.
* Keystone habits transform us by creating cultures that make clear the values that, in a difficult or uncertain moment, we might otherwise forget.

#### Ch 5: Starbucks and the Habit of Success: When Willpower Becomes Automatic

* Dozens of studies show that willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success.
* Self-discipline has a bigger effect on academic performance than does individual talent.
* Willpower is not a skill, but instead like a muscle; it gets tired as it works harder, and you can completely exhaust it.
* If you strengthen your willpower muscles in one part of your life, that strength will spill over and touch everything.
* We can teach ourselves how to handle moments of adversity by creating willpower habit loops.
* Starbucks teaches the LATTE method: Listen to the customer, Acknowledge the problem, Take action, Thank them, then Explain why the problem occurred.
* Willpower becomes habit by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives.
* Increasing someone's agency, or their feeling of control or decision-making authority, taxes them less in situations that require self-control.
