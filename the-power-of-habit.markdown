## The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business

by Charles Duhigg

### Prologue: The Habit Cure

* By focusing on just one habit, or a "keystone habit," we can teach ourselves to reprogram other parts of our lives as well.
* Most of the choices we make each day are not the product of well-considered decision making, but are instead habits.
* Habits can be changed if we understand how they work.

### Part One: The Habits of Individuals

#### Ch 1: The Habit Loop: How Habits Work

* If you picture the brain as an onion, then the outside layers are the most recent additions from an evolutionary perspective.
* The outside layers are where the most complex thinking occurs; the inside layers control our automatic behaviors.
* The basal ganglia, near the center, recalls and acts on patterns, storing habits while the rest of the brain goes to sleep.
* Chunking is when the brain converts a sequence of habits into an automatic routine, and is at the root of how habits form.
* Habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.
* An efficient brain makes for a smaller head and therefore easier childbirth, and also allows us to devote mental energy to other tasks.
* Our brain looks for a *cue* to signal which pattern to use. Upon receiving a *reward*, it assesses whether this routine is worth remembering.
* Over time, the cue-routine-reward loop becomes more automatic, and the cue and reward cause anticipation and craving. Eventually a habit is born. 
* Our brain cannot tell the difference between good and bad habits, and so bad habits are always lurking, waiting for the right cues and rewards.
* Without habit loops, our brains would shut down, overwhelmed by the minutiae of daily life.
* It is possible to learn and make unconscious choices without remembering anything about the lesson or decision making.
* By learning to observe the cues and rewards of habit loops, we can change the routines.

#### Ch 2: The Craving Brian: How to Create New Habits

* To cultivate a new habit, create a carving. A craving is what makes cues and rewards work, and what powers the habit loop.
* As a habit becomes stronger, the cue begins eliciting a pleasure response from our brain, thereby creating anticipation and cravings.
* New habits form by putting together a cue, routine, and reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.
* To overpower a habit, we must recognize which craving is driving the behavior. Otherwise we will subconsciously submit to it.
* A cue and reward, on their own, are not enough for a new habit to last; a craving prompted by the cue is always required.
* Think about a reward to create a craving; this will make it easier to endure the routine.
* What we crave doesn't have to have any material benefit, such as tingling from toothpaste or foaming from shampoo.
* Cravings are what drive habits, and figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier.
