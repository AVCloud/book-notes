## The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

### Part One: Paradigms and Principles

#### Inside Out

* The Character Ethic from early success literature focused on integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the Golden Rule.
* The Personality Ethic, by contrast, makes success a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques that lubricate the process of human interaction.
* If your character is fundamentally flawed, then if you employ good human relations techniques, you will be seen as manipulative. You will not be successful.
* Character communicates most eloquently. As Emerson once put it, "What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say."
* We experience everything through two mental maps: Realities, or the way things are, and values, or the way things should be.
* The influences of our lives, such as family, school, church, work environment, friends, associates, and current social paradigms, have all shaped our frame of reference, our paradigms, and our maps.
* These paradigms are the source of our attitudes and behaviors. We cannot act with integrity outside of them. We cannot maintain wholeness if we talk and walk differently than we see.
* The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, the more we can examine them, test them against reality, and listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a more objective view.
* If we want to make a relatively minor change in our lives, we can perhaps appropriately focus on attitudes and behaviors. But significant change requires working on our basic paradigms.
