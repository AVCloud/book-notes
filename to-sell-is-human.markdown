## To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others

by Daniel Pink

### Introduction

* The ability to move others to exchange what they have for what we have is crucial to our survival and our happiness.

### Part 1: Rebirth of a Salesman

#### Ch 1: We're All in Sales Now

* One out of every nine American workers works in sales, and by 2020 the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects 2 million new sales jobs.
* The same holds elsewhere around the world, even after the global financial implosion and the Internet.
* Beyond producing and consuming, we now focus on moving other people to part with their resources so that we both get what we want.
* People now spend 40% of their time at work engaged in non-sales selling, and they consider this aspect crucial to their professional success.
* The older someone is, and so the more experience that person has, the more moving others occupies her days and determines her success.
* The existing data shows that 1 in 9 Americans work in sales; but the other 8 in 9 engage in non-sales selling.

#### Ch 2: Entrepreneurship, Elasticity, and Ed-Med

* Very large enterprises and very small ones not only have differences in degree, but differences in kind.
* Entrepreneurs cannot specialize, they must wear many hats; and that is the first reason why more of us find ourselves in sales.
* 30% of American workers now work on their own; this may grow by 65 million and become the majority of the US workforce in 2020.
* Technology was supposed to make salespeople obsolete but transformed more people into sellers -- see Etsy, Square, Kickstarter, etc.
* Elasticity, or the new breadth of skills demanded by established companies, is the second reason why we're all in sales now.
* A world of flat organizations and tumultuous business conditions punishes fixed skills and prizes elastic ones.
* As elasticity of skills becomes more common, one particular category of skill it seems always to encompass is moving others.
* Education and health services, or Ed-Med, is the largest job sector in the U.S. economy, and the fastest growing sector in the world.
* Teachers and health care professionals sell and convince others to part with time, attention, and effort, for a better future.
* Irritation is challenging people to do something you want to do; agitation is challenging them to do something they want to do.
* Non-sales selling requires influencing, persuading, and changing behavior while balancing what others want and what you can provide them.
