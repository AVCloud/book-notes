## To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others

by Daniel Pink

### Introduction

* The ability to move others to exchange what they have for what we have is crucial to our survival and our happiness.

### Part 1: Rebirth of a Salesman

#### Ch 1: We're All in Sales Now

* One out of every nine American workers works in sales, and by 2020 the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects 2 million new sales jobs.
* The same holds elsewhere around the world, even after the global financial implosion and the Internet.
* Beyond producing and consuming, we now focus on moving other people to part with their resources so that we both get what we want.
* People now spend 40% of their time at work engaged in non-sales selling, and they consider this aspect crucial to their professional success.
* The older someone is, and so the more experience that person has, the more moving others occupies her days and determines her success.
* The existing data shows that 1 in 9 Americans work in sales; but the other 8 in 9 engage in non-sales selling.

#### Ch 2: Entrepreneurship, Elasticity, and Ed-Med

* Very large enterprises and very small ones not only have differences in degree, but differences in kind.
* Entrepreneurs cannot specialize, they must wear many hats; and that is the first reason why more of us find ourselves in sales.
* 30% of American workers now work on their own; this may grow by 65 million and become the majority of the US workforce in 2020.
* Technology was supposed to make salespeople obsolete but transformed more people into sellers -- see Etsy, Square, Kickstarter, etc.
* Elasticity, or the new breadth of skills demanded by established companies, is the second reason why we're all in sales now.
* A world of flat organizations and tumultuous business conditions punishes fixed skills and prizes elastic ones.
* As elasticity of skills becomes more common, one particular category of skill it seems always to encompass is moving others.
* Education and health services, or Ed-Med, is the largest job sector in the U.S. economy, and the fastest growing sector in the world.
* Teachers and health care professionals sell and convince others to part with time, attention, and effort, for a better future.
* Irritation is challenging people to do something you want to do; agitation is challenging them to do something they want to do.
* Non-sales selling requires influencing, persuading, and changing behavior while balancing what others want and what you can provide them.

#### Ch 3: From Caveat Emptor to Caveat Venditor

* Adjectives and interjections can reveal people's attitudes, since they often contain an emotional component that nouns lack.
* Selling makes us uncomfortable and disgusted because we believe its practice revolves around duplicity, dissembling, and double-dealing.
* The presence of people who wish to pawn bad wares as good wares tends to drive out the legitimate business.
* In a world of information asymmetry, the guiding principle is caveat emptor, or buyer beware.
* If you have just as much information as the seller, and a means to talk back, the new guiding principle is caveat venditor, or seller beware.
* When buyers can know more than sellers, the sellers are not the protectors and purveyors of information, but the curators and clarifiers of it.
* Our feelings about sales derive not from the inherent nature of selling, but the information asymmetry that long defined its context.
* But as long as there are complicated products where the potential for lucre is enormous, abide by caveat emptor.
* The low road is now harder to pass and the high road has become the better, more pragmatic, long-term route.
* There are no "natural" salespeople, in part because we're all naturally salespeople with a selling instinct.

### Part 2: How to Be

#### Ch 4: Attunement

* Attunement is the ability to bring one's actions and outlook into harmony with other people and with the context you're in.
* Power leads individuals to anchor too heavily on their own vantage point, insufficiently adjusting to others' perspective.
* Start your encounters assuming that you have less power; this will help you see other side's perspective, and in turn move them.
* Perspective-taking is a cognitive capacity, mostly about thinking; empathy is an emotional response, mostly about feeling.
* Perspective-taking is better than empathy, because you can submerge your own interests.
* People belong to groups, situations, and contexts, so pay attention to the relationships and connections of a person.
* Syncing our mannerisms and vocal patterns to someone else so that we both understand and can be understood is fundamental to attunement.
* Related to mimicry, touching someone on the upper arm or shoulder has positive results.
* The correlation between extraversion and sales in one study was only 0.07, or virtually non-existent.
* Extraverts can talk too much and listen too little, and fail to balance between asserting and holding back.
* Intraverts can be too shy to initiate and too timid to close.
* Ambiverts are the best movers because they're the most skilled attuners, knowing when to speak up and when to shut up.

*Sample Case*

* Jim Collins' favorite opening question is "Where are you from?" because it opens someone up easily.
* To master strategic mimicry: watch, then wait before applying, and finally wane, or become less conscious of what you're doing.
* Jeff Bezos uses an empty chair in meetings to represent the customer; let the chair represent whom you must be attuned to.
* A discussion map of a meeting has an X next to someone's name when they talk, and has arrows for directed comments.
* Finding similarities can help you attune yourself to others and help them attune themselves to you.
* Similarity is a key form of human connection, as people are more likely to move together when they share common ground.

#### Ch 5: Buoyancy

* How to stay afloat in the ocean of rejection, or buoyancy, is the second essential quality in moving others.
* Positive self-talk is better than negative self-talk, but most effective is to ask questions instead of make statements.
* The interrogative elicits answers, in which are strategies for actually carrying out the task.
* Moreover, interrogative self-talk inspires thoughts about autonomous and intrinsically motivated reasons to pursue a goal.
* Negative emotions narrow our vision and help us survive in the moment, namely fight or flight.
* Positive emotions broaden our ideas about actions, opening us to a wider range of thoughts, making us more receptive and creative.
* Believing in an offering leads to a deeper understanding of it, allowing sellers to better match what they have with what others need.
* A ratio of positive to negative emotions between 3:1 and 11:1 is ideal.
* Negative emotions offer us feedback on our performance, information on what's not working, and hints on how to do better.
* Unchecked levity makes you flighty, ungrounded, and unreal, while unchecked gravity leaves you in a heap of misery.
* Learned helplessness is a habit of people explaining negative events to themselves as permanent, pervasive, or personal.
* They believe that the negative conditions will last a long time, the causes are universal, and that they're the ones to blame.
* Optimism can stir persistence, steady us during challenges, and stoke the confidence that we can influence our surroundings.

*Sample Case*

* Next time you're getting ready to persuade others, ask yourself "Can I move these people?" Answer it, directly and in writing.
* Be more positive by displaying positive emotions of joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, and love.
* Explain bad events as temporary, specific, and external, and find ways to "dispute" and "de-catastrophize" negative explanations.
* Thinking through the gloom-and-doom scenarios and mentally preparing for the very worst can help some people manage their anxieties.
* Writing yourself a fake rejection letter can make consequences seem less dire, and even reveal soft spots in what you're presenting.
